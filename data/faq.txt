Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons? How do I upscale? How do I increase my image‚Äôs resolution? How do I create variations? What does U and V do? What is U1-4, V1-4? What is an upscale? What is a variation?

**U** UPSCALE: The Uüî¢ buttons separate your chosen image from the grid, making it easier to download and giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.

**V** VARIATION: The Vüî¢ buttons create 4 [variations](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/variations) of the selected image while keeping the style and composition.

Clicking on U doesn't use GPU time in version 5 and 6 but upscales creative, subtle, 2x and 4x consume several GPU minutes. [Read more about upscales](<https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers>)
Variations use GPU time.

Q: What is Vary (Region)? Vary region button? How do I use Vary (Region)? Inpainting? How do I inpaint?

`Vary (Region)` allows you to select and regenerate specific parts of an image.
1. Click the `Vary (Region)` button underneath upscaled images to open the editing interface.
2. Select the areas of your image that you want modified. You can choose between a rectangular or a freehand selection tool in the bottom left.
3. (Optional) In `Remix mode`, edit your prompt at the bottom to guide the modifications. *Use the command `/settings` and enable `Remix mode`.*
4. Submit your `Vary (Region)` request ‚ûú

__Note:__ A larger selection provides more room for changes, while a smaller selection may result in more subtle modifications.

:bug: If you don't see the `Vary (Region)` button, make sure you're on the latest version of Discord, and try restarting the app.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a GPU minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms of the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query? Do upscales cost GPU time? Do variations use GPU time?

Imagine Midjourney is a ship on the imagination sea, driven by GPU (Graphics processing unit) engines. When you request an image, it's like setting a course. The "cost" is how hard the engine works, **measured in GPU time**.

With the latest models:
- `/imagine`: Costs about 1 GPU minute
- Variations: Cost slightly less GPU time
- Initial Upscales: Split the existing grid, they cost no extra GPU time (in v5 and v6)
- 2x/4x/Creative/Subtle Upscale: Cost more GPU time, various minutes.

__Note:__ Requests like panning, Vary (Region), using older models, or adding specific instructions push the engine more, increasing the use of GPU time.

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left? How do I see how much I have used? How do I see how many hours I have left? Where can I check how many prompts I have left? How many images can I make? How can I see my queue? Where do I check my jobs? How do I check how many jobs I have left? /info? Is my subscription active? How do I check my subscription status? Is my subscription canceled? How do I check how many images I have left?

Use the command `/info` to check your status and usage.
This also updates your roles and access.

`Fast Time Remaining` shows how much fast GPU time you have available.

---

Q: Can I use my GPU? Can I run this locally? Can I run this on my computer?

Midjourney runs on datacenter grade graphics cards, it can only be used through our Discord Bot or our official Midjourney website.

---

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details? What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? How do I enable the additional fast time?

You can purchase additional fast GPU hours at the current rate of US$4 per hour (plus VAT). These purchased GPU hours do not expire, but you must have an active subscription to use them.
You can buy them via your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) on the Midjourney website.

__Note:__ These hours are used after your monthly and bonus GPU fast time.

# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?  My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed? How to get relaxed generation? Relax job? Relax generation? How to swap between relax and fast mode?

To toggle between Relax, Fast and Turbo mode, use the commands `/relax`, `/fast` or `/turbo`.
üîπImages made in Relax mode take longer to complete but are unlimited.
üîπImages made in Fast mode are quicker to start but use your limited GPU fast time.
üîπImages made in Turbo mode are generated much faster but consume up to four times the cost of a `Fast` generation.

__Note:__ Relax mode is not available on the Basic plan.
[Read more about GPU time and Speed modes.](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/fast-relax)

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode uses a dynamic queuing system that resets with each of your monthly time renewal.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight? Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while? What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before? Relax mode is running slower?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours? 

We've got three Speed modes to generate images. Use the commands `/relax`, `/fast` or `/turbo` to select the speed you want:
üîπ**Relax** mode adds your job to a dynamic queue, it can be slower but is unlimited.
üîπ**Fast** mode starts your image right away but uses your limited GPU fast time.
üîπ**Turbo** mode starts your job right away and processes it as fast as possible but consumes four times as much GPU time as in Fast mode.

Each plan comes with a limited amount of monthly GPU fast time. You can buy more on [your account page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) on the website.
The Basic plan does not include access to Relax mode.

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? Will my time get added to the next month? Does the subscription reset my hours? Do I keep my minutes? Do fast GPU minutes stack on each month? Does fast time rollover? Rollover? Roll over? Do I lose my hours when I change plan? Do I lose my hours when I cancel?

üîπ**Monthly fast time does not roll over**. It is reset with each monthly renewal.
üîπBonus hours from ranking expire one month (30 days) after being awarded.
üîπAdditional purchased fast hours do not expire.

__Note:__ To create images, you need an active subscription.

---
# -------------------- ------TURBO------ --------------------

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs in Turbo mode are generated up to four times faster but also **consume up to four times as much fast GPU time** as a typical Fast mode job.

Switch to Turbo mode with the command `/turbo` or select ‚ö°Turbo mode in your `/settings`.

__Note:__ If Turbo mode can‚Äôt be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

# -------------------- ----PRIVATE---- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? Pay for stealth mode? What if I don‚Äôt want my images to appear in the gallery?

Midjourney is a community for sharing and exploration. If you prefer not to participate, you can subscribe to the Pro or Mega plan. These two plans have a feature called `Stealth` that lets you choose what to publish and what to make private (unpublish) in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive).

---

Q: What's private mode? What‚Äôs stealth mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images? How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts? How do I go private? How do I go stealth? How much does private cost? How much does stealth cost? I can‚Äôt unpublish on the website? Stealth mode? How do I keep my images private? Are all my images private automatically? Will my gallery become private? Why can users still interact even though I bought private? Are all my images stealth automatically? Will my gallery be stealth? Why can users interact even though I have stealth mode enabled? How to unpublish images? What is publish and unpublish?

[Stealth mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth) is a feature of the Pro and Mega plans that allows you to make your images private (unpublished) in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive). Unpublished images cannot be seen on the website by any members other than yourself.

To enable Stealth mode and keep all **new** images private on the Midjourney website, run the `/stealth` command. You can also add it to individual prompts by adding the `--stealth` parameter.

__Note:__ Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels! To keep images completely hidden, you must [make them in Direct Messages](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/direct-messages) or [in a private server](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/add-the-bot). 

---

Q: How to hide images? What is hide? What does hide do on the website? Is hide the same as private mode? Hide images?

`Hide` only hides images from yourself - it‚Äôs used to organize [your own gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) by hiding images you don‚Äôt like from your view. **Hidden images are still visible to all other members**, it is not the same as unpublishing them.
To make your images private, you will need the Pro or Mega plan; those allow you to unpublish images and use [Stealth mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth).

To hide images on the website, go to your [Archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive), select the images you want to hide, and click `...More` (next to Download). You can then bulk hide/unhide.

---

Q: Is private permanent? Does stealth last forever? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth? Are unpublished images visible once my subscription ends?

Any images unpublished using Stealth mode during your subscription will remain private even after your subscription ends, or if you downgrade your plan.

---

Q: I can‚Äôt use the stealth option in my web settings? I can‚Äôt see the unpublish button? I don‚Äôt see the unpublish button?

If the Stealth toggle doesn‚Äôt appear, try signing out of [the website](https://www.midjourney.com/) and then signing back in.

---

Q: How do I unpublish my images? Unpublish old images? Bulk unpublish? Unpublish already made images? Batch unpublish?

Subscribers to the Pro and Mega plan can bulk unpublish their images from the website. To do this, go to your [Archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive), select the images you want to unpublish, and click `...More` next to Download. You can then bulk publish/unpublish.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: How do I change my aspect ratio? How to change aspect ratio? How can I specify image width? How can I specify image height? How can I change the dimensions? How to make not square images? What is the prompt for width and height? Can I adjust the width and height? What is --ar? How do I make a desktop background? How do I make 16:9?

Change the aspect ratio of your image by including the `--ar` parameter at the end of your prompt.
For example: `a robot on a sailboat --ar 4:1`

[Read more about aspect ratios](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/aspect-ratios)

---

Q: The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

üîπ`Upscale (Subtle)` is the closest match to the original image.
üîπ`Upscale (Creative)` adds the most detail when upscaling an image.
Running the upscale again will give you a different result.

[Read more about Upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using a more recent version, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in `/fast` mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image‚Äôs resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` parameter in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúLight Upscale Redo‚Äù button under v3 and v4 upscaled images.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is "beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is upbeta?

Beta upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds flat textured smooth detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--upbeta` parameter in a prompt, or hit the `Beta Upscale Redo` button under v3 and v4 upscaled images.

[More about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print them out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution?

For square images, the upscalers will produce the following:
v5, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0 grid upscale: 1024x1024 px
v5, 5.1, 5.2 (2x) Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px
v5, 5.1, 5.2 (4x) Upscaler: 4098 x 4098 px
v6 (Creative) and (Subtle) Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.

[Read more about resolution and upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)
If you need larger or higher resolution images, please look into 3rd party upscale softwares.

---

Q: Is the v4 upscaler broken? Why are my Version 4 upscales coming out different?

The default upscaler for v4 takes the prompt into account, unlike previous upscalers. This means it sometimes makes changes to the grid image as part of the process...for better or for worse. If you don‚Äôt like the results, try the `Beta Upscale Redo` button. The beta upscaler tends to stick closer to the grid image than the Version 4 default upscaler.

---

Q: Where has the upscale 4x button gone? Upscale 2x and Upscale 4x do now show for me? Have you removed 4x upscale? 4x upscale? Upscale (4x)?

At the moment, version 6 only has `Upscale (Subtle)` and `Upscale (Creative)` which are both Upscales 2x.
If you want an Upscale (4x) you need to go back to --v 5.2. Use the command `/settings`, select Version 5.2 and create a new /imagine - new images will have the 4x Upscale button.

---

Q: Quality Buttons Disappeared from Settings? Quality Buttons? Quality Buttons Gone? Quality Buttons Disappear? How to set Quality? Quality in Settings?

The Quality buttons have been removed from the `/settings` panel because on v4 and v5 models the default quality setting is already the maximum value (q 1). If you wish to lower the quality setting or use higher values on older versions, you can use the [Quality Parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality) on your prompt or set a [custom suffix](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/settings-and-presets#prefer-suffix) to automatically add a custom quality parameter.

---

Q: How to have the same character made but in different scenes? Can I keep the same character in my images? Is there an option to keep the same character? How to use --cref? Can I add a character reference?

You can use the Character Reference parameter `--cref` followed by a space and a link to your image for the characters in your results to be based on a specific image. You can add multiple links to have multiple character references, make sure to have a space between each link.
For example: `Short blond man holding a puppy --cref https://pic2.png`

__Note:__ The --cref parameter works best with references created in Midjourney.
You can add text, image prompts, and other parameters to guide the results.

# -------------------- IMAGE PROMPTS  --------------------

Q: What does the --iw argument do? What does the --iw comment do? What does --iw do?

The `--iw` (Image Weight) parameter allows you to adjust how much the image prompt will be considered in the final result. The default `--iw` value in Version 6 is 1, and it can be set to values between 0 and 3.

Q: Reference image? Use photo as reference? How do I upload an image? How do I get an image link? How do I use my own image? How do I upload or use an image from my hard-drive for an image prompt? Image prompt? How can I attach an image? Can I use an image as a starting point? Can I use my images? Can I send images to the AI? Can I give an image to the AI? I've seen a few people using source images, how does this work? Can I use an image? My own photo? My own personal photo? Edit my image?

To add images to text prompts:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the image to Discord (make sure to click send/hit enter).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Right-click and copy the link to the image or media (ending in .jpg, .png, or .webp). If you don‚Äôt see this option, left-click on the image to open it, then right-click to copy the link.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Start typing `/imagine` and click the popup.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Paste the image link(s) with a space between each link.
5Ô∏è‚É£Add a text prompt and any parameters.

[Here‚Äôs a step by step guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), you cannot assign a negative weight to an image prompt. The value for the image weight parameter, `--iw`, must be between 0 and 3.

---

Q: Why does it add blob to my link? Blob link?

If `blob:` is added when you paste an image link, that means the image wasn‚Äôt sent.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Attach the image on Discord.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Hit enter/click send** to fully upload the image on Discord.
3Ô∏è‚É£ You can now drag the image, or right-click to copy the link/address to the image.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called "init" images. "Init" images are not currently supported, you can not modify your own images through Midjourney.
You can use an image URL as part of your prompt to add an image prompt. However, these are used as prompts or references, not as a starting point.

[Read more about Image Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What‚Äôs the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

The maximum value for the image weight parameter (`--iw`) is 3.

[Read more about Image Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Is there a way to mix two images. Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

**Use `/blend` to mix two or more images together.**

[Read more about Blend](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/blend-1)

---

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it ‚Äî or --? Is it - or - -?

To manually input a parameter, type a double hyphen with no space (`--`) followed by the parameter name. There should only be a space before the double hyphen and after the parameter name.
For example: `landscape --ar 3:2`

__Note:__ You can use an em dash (`‚Äî`) instead of a double hyphen.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to blend different prompts. By adding a number right after the double colons, without a space, you can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result. The default weight value is 1.
In this example: `space:: ship::2`
The prompt `space` has the default weight value of 1 while the prompt `ship` has a weight value of 2, giving it twice as much influence.

[Read more about Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts)

---

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts? How should I write my prompts?  What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts? Do prompts have an order? Does word order matter? Does word sequence matter? Is there a template for prompts?

[Here is a guide on effective text prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

Text prompts are not case-sensitive, while parameters are case-sensitive and must be entered using lowercase letters.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), punctuation is interpreted similarly to natural language. Compose your text prompt as you would structure a sentence to describe an image.
Some characters have a specific function:
üîπ"Quotation marks" indicate that the text enclosed within them should appear in the image
üîπDouble hyphens (`--`) or an em dash (`‚Äî`) are used to manually input a parameter.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Different versions of Midjourney have different limits. The current model, Version 6, is much better at understanding prompts, similarly to natural language. You can type a single word, emoji or character but you can also input full sentences, it‚Äôs up to you!

[Read more about prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your `Stylization` value might be too high, try lowering it.
`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

---

Q: What about ‚ÄúUnreal engine‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúArtstation‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúOctane render‚Äù?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

Engage in our [#prompt-chat](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713) community to discuss prompts with other users.

---

Q: What does quality do? How do you use  --q? How do you use quality? What is --q?

The quality parameter (`--q`) changes how much time is spent generating an image.
You can only use the following values: `.25`, `.5`, and `1` in Version 6. Larger values are rounded down to default value of 1.

[Read more about Quality](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality)

---

Q: How do you use --s? How do you use stylize? What does stylize do? What is --s?

`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? How can I get an individual image without upscaling? No seed? Seed on upscale? Only grid seed? V5 seed? I can not get the seed? Can‚Äôt get the seed number? When I react with the envelope nothing happens, I don‚Äôt get the seed? How can I find the seed? How do I retrieve the seed number of an image? How do I get the seed of an image? What does ‚Äìseed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed?

Each set of four images made in Midjourney uses a random seed number as a starting point.

React to your image with the :envelope: emoji for the Midjourney Bot to send you the seed in a Direct Message.

Use the `--seed` parameter, with a value between 0 and 4294967295, to give the bot a specific starting point.
If you use the same seed and prompt as another image, the bot will produce an identical or very similar set of four images. This is useful when using similar prompts to test how the changes affect the result.

__Note:__ Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency.

Q: How to transfer an image to another channel? Can I move my image out of the newbies channel? Can I work with my old generations? My old generation is not responding to buttons? Can i upscale my old image from newbies channel? How to use /show?

Use the `/show` command to transfer an image to another channel, or ‚Äúrevive‚Äù a job that's not working.
You‚Äôll need the Job ID which you can find in your [gallery](https://midjourney.com/archive) on the website: Open your image, select the Options Icon, then `Copy` and `Job ID`.

# -------------------- ------VIDEO----- --------------------

Q: How do I get a video of my grid generating? Video? --video? Can I use ‚Äìvideo on an upscale?

You can ask the bot to record the creation of the image grid you prompted.

Add the `--video` parameter at the end of your prompt. Once the image has been rendered, react to it with the :envelope: emoji.

__Note:__ Videos only work on the initial grid, not upscaled images.

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Interaction Failed"? I am getting ‚Äúinteraction failed‚Äù? I am getting ‚Äúapplication did not respond‚Äù? Bot interaction failing?

First check  <#942231458918064148> for known issues.
If you are getting an error, try restarting Discord, updating it, or reinstalling it.

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"? I get an error when I try to create a thread?

Discord allows this server a maximum number of active threads. When older threads are archived, you can create a new thread. Until space becomes available, you can work in Direct Messages with the Bot or invite the Bot to your server.

A green button to accept the [Terms of Service](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service) should appear with your first `/imagine` command.
Use the official Discord app and try several times if you don't see the TOS button or get an error accepting it.

üñ•Ô∏è**PC/Mac**  Do a hard restart of Discord with `Alt+F4` or `‚åò+Q`.
üì± **Mobile** `Update` the Discord app. If that doesn‚Äôt work, `reinstall` the Discord app.

---

Q: Is there a list of banned words? Where can I see the banned words?

The current Midjourney models do not use a banned word list. Rather, the bot attempts to parse the context of the prompt. Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it. Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

---

Q: What does progress images have been disabled mean? What does process images have been disabled mean?

In-progress images are sometimes disabled temporarily for performance reasons. Do not worry! Final results will still be sent normally when the generation is complete.

---

Q: Bot down? Status? Is the bot down? 

You can check our [**status page**](https://status.midjourney.com/) and read the  <#942231458918064148> channel for updates.

If you‚Äôre experiencing an issue not covered on the status page or channel, please describe your issue here. Include the full error message, if one exists.

---

Q: Cannot use --version 6 with only a single image prompt? Only a single image prompt? Please add another image prompt, or a text prompt?

If you want to use just one image reference, you must include a text prompt with it. Prompts with multiple image references do not require a text prompt.

For example: `https://pic1.png a cool person flying like superman`

---

Q: --stylize must be between 0 and 1000 with --version 6? stylize must be between 0 and 1000?

Use the command `/settings` and select `Style Med` to use the Version‚Äôs default value for Stylize.

`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

---

Q: My images won't finish? Stops at 93%? 93% bug? Stops at 62%? 62% bug?

In some cases, the bot may fail to return the finished image in Discord. You can find the finished image in [your gallery](https://midjourney.com/archive) on the Midjourney website.

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [/show command](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/show-job) followed by the job ID.

---

Q: Describe Error? Error with describe? Error with /describe? 504 Deadline Exceeded?

If you get the error ‚Äú504 Deadline Exceeded‚Äù when trying to use the `/describe` command, it means the image file you are uploading is too large. Use a smaller image and try again.

Q: ‚Äìstop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter will stop your generation at partway through.

In this example: `/imagine prompt: a field of flowers --stop 50`
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in a softer less detailed image.
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image.

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing?

Some jobs may appear *ephemeral* when certain words or phrases are mentioned. These temporary messages are only visible to **you** and disappear when you close, refresh, or switch instances of Discord. You'll know it's an ephemeral job when you see the text "Only you can see this message" at the bottom of the bot's message.

Don't worry, even if these jobs disappear from Discord, you can still find them in your [Gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) on the Midjourney website.

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [/show command](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/show-job) followed by the job ID.

Q: Does Midjourney know about this style, artist, movie, game, or media?

Midjourney has a wide variety of subjects and topics in its dataset. If you find it is unfamiliar with a topic you reference in your prompt, you may need to be more specific. You can also try to provide an [image prompt](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts), [character reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/character-reference), or [style reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-reference).
