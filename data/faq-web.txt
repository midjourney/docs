Q: How do I create variations? What is a variation? Vary subtle or strong? What is the difference between Vary subtle and strong?

Create variations of an image you made on Midjourney to generate new images based on it.

To create variations: Open your image, find `Vary` on the right side, and click the `Subtle` or `Strong` button. When you’re in the [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) space, hover over an image to get these buttons.
🔹Vary **Subtle**: Retains the basic composition and colors, creating four new images with slightly different details.
🔹Vary **Strong**: Creates four new interpretations of your prompt, while referencing elements of the original.

__Note:__ To edit your prompt when making a variation, use Reframe and modify the prompt, with or without changing the dimensions of the image.

In the [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) space, the `↻ Rerun` button resubmits your request to generate a new set of four images using the same prompt and parameters. It’s like telling the bot to try again.

__Note:__ To modify your prompt before rerunning it, click the `🅃 Use` button next to `↻ Rerun`. This will send your full command to your creation bar, allowing you to edit it before submitting.

How can I add a new subject to inpainting? Why don’t I have the prompt area input in Vary Region? Where is the text box for Vary Region? What is Repaint? Can I repaint parts of an image? How to use Repaint?

`Repaint` allows you to select and regenerate specific parts of an image.
1. Click on the image you want to edit, and click the `Repaint` button to open the editing interface.
2. Select the areas of your image that you want modified. You can choose between a rectangular or a freehand selection tool in the bottom left.
3. (Optional) Edit your prompt at the bottom to guide the modifications.
4. Submit your `Repaint` request ➜

__Note:__ A larger selection provides more room for changes, while a smaller selection may result in more subtle modifications.

To generate images:
1. Enter a description of the image you want in the `Imagine…` textbox located at the top of the page. This input is called the “prompt”.
Learn more about structuring prompts [here](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2).
2. Press enter and the bot will generate a set of four images.
%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1201909699793145876/1233779318950330448/ImagineWeb.gif

You can find and interact with your images in your [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) space.

__Additional information:__
- On the left side of the textbox, use the `+` button to add images to your prompt.
- On the right side of the textbox, use the button to see and adjust your current settings.
- Organize your images in your [Archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive).

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Is it possible to edit a prompt without restarting? How to edit my prompt? What is remix? Can I change the prompt after I’ve made it? Can I change the prompt? Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image after I have generated different versions? Can I change the prompt? How do I recreate one of my images with a small change? Can I edit my prompt? Can I edit one of my prompts? Can I add, remove, or change just one word in my prompt? What is remix?

The `Reframe` button lets you edit your prompt while modifying your image. Open the image you want to edit, and select the Reframe button. On the right side, you can edit the prompt.
🔹If you do not change the image ratio (`Reframe`) or `Zoom` out, this will create four new images based on your new prompt and elements from the original image.
🔹If you modify the image ratio (`Reframe`) or `Zoom` out, the new prompt will only affect the expanded zones of your image.

If you want to edit the prompt for a new job, click the `🅃 Use` button next to `↻ Rerun`, or right-click/open the image and in `Use`, choose `Prompt`. This will send your full command to your creation bar, allowing you to edit it before submitting.

# -------------------- -------GPU------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a GPU minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms of the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query? Do upscales cost GPU time? Do variations use GPU time?

Imagine Midjourney is a ship on the imagination sea, driven by GPU (Graphics processing unit) engines. When you request an image, it's like setting a course. The "cost" is how hard the engine works, **measured in GPU time**.

With the latest models:
- A new `Imagine` set of four images: Costs about 1 GPU minute
- Variations: Cost slightly less GPU time
- Upscales 2x/4x/Creative/Subtle: Cost more GPU time, various minutes.

__Note:__ Requests like Reframe, Repaint, using older models, or adding specific instructions push the engine more, increasing the use of GPU time.

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details? How do I enable the additional fast time?

You can purchase additional fast GPU hours at the current rate of US$4 per hour (plus VAT). These purchased GPU hours do not expire, but you must have an active subscription to use them.
You can buy them via your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/).

__Note:__ These hours are used after your bonus and monthly GPU fast time.

# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?  My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed? How to get relaxed generation? Relax job? Relax generation?

To choose what `Speed` mode to use, open your settings – at the bottom of your `Model` options, select the `Relax`, `Fast`, or `Turbo` button.
🔹Images made in Relax mode take longer to complete but are unlimited.
🔹Images made in Fast mode are quicker to start but use your limited GPU fast time.
🔹Images made in Turbo mode are generated much faster but cost twice as much GPU time as a `Fast` generation.

__Note:__ Relax mode is not available on the Basic plan.
[Read more about GPU time and Speed modes.](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/fast-relax)

%image=https://cdn.midjourney.com/u/ff03153e-6e8a-48b4-87d0-5acd0a123688/89c0ed9a7b4043abf5cced91683de77cce3094486a54abbf8beb951ae7b969d1.png

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, Relax mode uses a dynamic queuing system that resets with each of your monthly time renewal.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight. Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while.  What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours?

We've got three Speed modes to generate images:
🔹`Relax` mode adds your job to a dynamic queue, it can be slower but is unlimited.
🔹`Fast` mode starts your image right away but uses your limited GPU fast time.
🔹`Turbo` mode starts your job right away and processes it as fast as possible but costs twice as much GPU time as `Fast` jobs.

Each plan comes with a limited amount of monthly GPU fast time. You can buy more on your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account).
The Basic plan does not include access to Relax mode.

🔹Additional purchased fast hours do not expire.

__Note:__ To create images, you need an active subscription.

---

# -------------------- ------TURBO------ --------------------

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs in Turbo mode are generated up to four times faster but also **consume up to four times as much fast GPU time** as a typical Fast mode job.

Click the settings icon on the right side of your `Imagine...` textbox and, at the bottom of your `Model` options, select the `Turbo` button to activate Turbo mode.

__Note:__ If Turbo mode can’t be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? Pay for stealth mode? What if I don’t want my images to appear in the gallery?

Midjourney is a community for sharing and exploration.
If you prefer not to participate, you can subscribe to the Pro or Mega plan. These two plans include the [`Stealth` Mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth) feature that lets you choose what to publish and what to make private (unpublish) in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive).

---

Q: What's private mode? What’s stealth mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images? How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts? How do I go private? How do I go stealth? How much does private cost? How much does stealth cost? I can’t unpublish on the website? Stealth mode? How do I keep my images private?

Will my gallery be stealth? Why can users interact even though I have stealth mode enabled? How to unpublish images? What is publish and unpublish?

[`Stealth` mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth) is a feature of the Pro and Mega plans that allows you to make your images private (unpublished) in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive). Unpublished images cannot be seen on the website by any members other than yourself.

To enable Stealth mode and keep all **__new__** images private, toggle the `Stealth` button in your settings to `On`. You can also add it to individual prompts by adding the `--stealth` parameter.

Q: How to hide images? What is hide? What does hide do on the website? Is hide the same as private mode? Hide images? How can I delete an image? How to delete images from my feed? How can I remove an image? Hide images?

`Hide` only hides images from yourself - it’s used to organize [your own gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) by hiding images you don’t like from your view. **Hidden images are still visible to all other members**, it is not the same as unpublishing them.

To hide images, go to your [Archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive), select the images you want to hide, and click `...More` (next to Download). You can then bulk hide/unhide.

__Note:__ For your images to be private, you will need the Pro or Mega plan; those plans allow you to unpublish images and use [Stealth mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth).

---

Q: Is private permanent? Does stealth last forever? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth? Are unpublished images visible once my subscription ends?

Any images unpublished using Stealth mode during your subscription will remain private even after your subscription ends, or if you downgrade your plan.

---

Q: I can’t use the stealth option in my settings? I can’t see the unpublish button?

If you have the Pro or Mega plan but the `Stealth` toggle doesn’t appear, try signing out of the website and then signing back in.

---

Q: How do I unpublish my images? Unpublish old images? Bulk unpublish? Unpublish already made images? Batch unpublish?

Subscribers to the Pro and Mega plan can bulk unpublish their images from the website. To do this, go to your [Archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive), select the images you want to unpublish, and click `...More` next to Download. You can then bulk publish/unpublish.

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using a more recent version, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in Fast mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image’s resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` parameter in a prompt, or hit the “Light Upscale Redo” button on images made in v3 or v4.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print them out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution?

When generating a set of square images using versions 5, 5.1, 5.2, and 6.0, the images will have a dimension of 1024x1024 pixels.

You can then upscale your images:
🔹v5, 5.1, 5.2 (2x) Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px
🔹v5, 5.1, 5.2 (4x) Upscaler: 4098 x 4098 px
🔹v6 Creative and Subtle Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.

[Read more about resolution and upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)
If you need larger or higher resolution images, please look into 3rd party upscale softwares.

---

Q: Where has the upscale 4x button gone? Upscale 2x and Upscale 4x do now show for me? Have you removed 4x upscale? 4x upscale? Upscale (4x)?

At the moment, version 6 only has `Subtle` and `Creative` Upscales, which are both 2x Upscales.
Upscale (4x) is only available for images created in our v5 models. At the right side of the `Imagine…` textbox, click the Settings button at the right side, and from the `Version` dropdown, select `5.2`. Images created in this model will have the `Upscale` options `2x` and `4x`.

Q: How do you use --s? How do you use stylize? What does stylize do? What is --s? What is stylization? Which stylization value is better? Stylize should be a number between? How to use stylization?

`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
🔹Lower values will follow your prompt closely.
🔹Higher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

# -------------------- CHARACTER REFERENCE --------------------

Q: How to have the same character made but in different scenes? Can I keep the same character in my images? Is there an option to keep the same character? How to use --cref? Can I add a character reference?

You can use the Character Reference parameter `--cref` followed by a space and a link to your image for the characters in your results to be based on a specific image. You can add multiple links to have multiple character references, make sure to have a space between each link.
For example: `Short blond man holding a puppy --cref https://pic2.png`

__Note:__ The `--cref` parameter works best with references created in Midjourney.
You can add text, image prompts, and other parameters to guide the results.

[Read more about the Character Reference parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/character-reference)

Can I personalize my style? Can I personalise my style? How do I get my personal code? Where do I find my personal code? Where do I find my --p code? Can I train my own model?

The Personalization feature learns your preferences over time through images you've rated (on the [Rate Images](https://www.midjourney.com/rank) page).

Add the Personalize parameter `--p` at the end of your prompt to tailor the model to your preferences, or toggle `Personalize` to `On` in your settings for all new prompts to have it. Your personal code is automatically added after it.
Copy your code from the prompt to share it with other users, and try codes from others by pasting one of theirs after `--p`.

__Note:__ You can combine personalization with other parameters available in Version 6.
You can adjust the strength of your personal styling by combining it with the [Stylization parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize), with a value from 0 to 1000. A higher value will show your styling more but may dismiss some specifics of your prompt. 

[Read more about the Personalize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/personalization)
If you want to influence the style with your own image(s), set an image as a [Style Reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-reference).

---

Q: Can I use someone else's personal style parameter? Can I use someone else's --p code? Can others user my personal code? Can others user my --p code? Can other members use my personalize code? Can other members user my personalise code? 

When you use the Personalize parameter `--p`, your unique personal code is automatically added after it. You can share this code with other members as well as try one of their codes by pasting it after `--p`.

[Read more about the Personalize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/personalization)

---

Q: Why do I get “Not enough ratings”? Not enough ratings? Where do I get more ratings, I get the error "Not enough ratings"?

To use the [Personalization feature](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/personalization) you need to rate enough images for it to learn your preferences.
Go to the [`Rank Images` page](https://www.midjourney.com/rank), and select your favorite image between the two. If you're uncertain or don't like either, Press `→ Skip`.

You can see how many images you've rated at the top; the personalization feature will work once you have a ranking count of about 200 images.

---

# -------------------- IMAGE PROMPTS  --------------------

Q: What does the --iw parameter do? What does the --iw comment do? What does --iw do?

The `--iw` (Image Weight) parameter allows you to adjust how much the image prompt will be considered in the final result. The default `--iw` value in Version 6 is 1, and it can be set to values between 0 and 3.

%image=https://s.mj.run/SacTjDbYf0k

Q: Reference image? Use photo as reference? How do I upload an image? How do I get an image link? How do I use my own image? How do I upload or use an image from my hard-drive for an image prompt? Image prompt? How can I attach an image? Can I use an image as a starting point? Can I use my images? Can I send images to the AI? Can I give an image to the AI? I've seen a few people using source images, how does this work? Can I use an image? My own photo? My own personal photo? Edit my image?

Click the `+` button on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add images.
You can use an image in three different ways; hover over it to select the option of your choice. Shift-click to select multiple options.
🔹`Image Prompt` (icon: picture)
By default, uploaded images are added as image prompts. 
If you only use one image prompt, you’ll need to add a text description.
If you use two or more image prompts, the bot will blend them. Adding a text description becomes optional.
🔹`Style Reference` (icon: paper clip)
The image(s) will influence the style or aesthetic.
🔹`Character Reference` (icon: portrait)
The characters in your images will be based on your character reference(s). This works best with references created in Midjourney. You can add text, image prompts, and other parameters to guide the results.

__Note:__ References are used as parameters, they cannot be used without a prompt.
The following parameters have no effect on image prompts: Stylize, Chaos, Weird, Style Reference.

%image=https://s.mj.run/Z7tYu8DYi9I

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), you cannot assign a negative weight to an image prompt. The value for the image weight parameter `--iw` must be between 0 and 3.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called "init" images. "Init" images are not currently supported, you can not modify your own images through Midjourney.
You can click the `+` button on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add images. However, these are used as prompts or references, not as a starting point.

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What’s the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

The maximum value for the image weight parameter (`--iw`) is 3.

%image=https://s.mj.run/SacTjDbYf0k

---

Q: Is there a way to mix two images? Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

Click the `+` button on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add images.
If you only use one image, you’ll need to add a text description.
If you use two or more images, the bot will blend them. Adding a text description is optional.

__Note:__ The following parameters have no effect on blends: Stylize, Chaos, Weird, Style Reference.

---

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it — or --? Is it - or - -?

To manually input a parameter, type a double hyphen with no space (`--`) followed by the parameter name. There should only be a space before the double hyphen and after the parameter name.
For example: `landscape --ar 3:2`

__Note:__ You can use an em dash (`—`) instead of a double hyphen.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to blend different prompts. By adding a number right after the double colons, without a space, you can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result. The default weight value is 1.
In this example: `space:: ship::2`
The prompt `space` has the default weight value of 1 while the prompt `ship` has a weight value of 2, giving it twice as much influence.

[Read more about Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts)

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

Text prompts are not case-sensitive, while parameters are case-sensitive and must be entered using lowercase letters.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter? Are there any special punctuation characters? Is punctuation important?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), punctuation is interpreted similarly to natural language. Compose your text prompt as you would structure a sentence to describe an image.

Some characters have a specific function:
🔹"Quotation marks" indicate that the text enclosed within them should appear in the image
🔹Double hyphens (`--`) or an em dash (`—`) are used to manually input a parameter.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Different versions of Midjourney have different limits. The current model, Version 6, is much better at understanding prompts, similarly to natural language. You can type a single word, emoji or character but you can also input full sentences, it’s up to you!

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt?

Your `Stylization` value might be too high, try lowering it.
`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
🔹Lower values will follow your prompt closely.
🔹Higher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? How can I get an individual image without upscaling? No seed? Seed on upscale? Only grid seed? V5 seed? I can not get the seed? Can’t get the seed number? When I react with the envelope nothing happens, I don’t get the seed? How can I find the seed? How do I retrieve the seed number of an image? How do I get the seed of an image? What does –seed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed?

Each set of four images made in Midjourney uses a random seed number as a starting point.
To find your image’s seed number, open the dropdown menu, select `Copy` and `Seed`.

Use the `--seed` parameter, with a value between 0 and 4294967295, to give the bot a specific starting point.
If you use the same seed and prompt as another image, the bot will produce an identical or very similar set of four images. This is useful when using similar prompts to test how the changes affect the result.

__Note:__ Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency.

If you get a unique trace with three words, click `Report Bug` at the bottom left and send us a report explaining the issue.

Q: Is there a list of banned words? Where can I see the banned words? AI moderator thinks this is against community standards? Banned prompt? My prompt was blocked? Prompt blocked for no reason? 

The current Midjourney models do not use a banned word list. Rather, the bot attempts to parse the context of the prompt. Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it. Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

Q: Bot down? Status? Is the bot down? 

If you are experiencing jobs not starting, or long wait times, click `Report Bug` at the bottom left. Hovering over `System Status` or `Wait times` will display more information. If your issue is not listed under those views, please send us a report explaining the issue.

You can also view the current status of older models on the [status page](<https://status.midjourney.com/>).

Q: Can’t use with only a single image prompt? Single image prompt with no text? Only a single image prompt? Only one image in prompt?

If you want to use just one image reference, you must include a text prompt with it. Prompts with multiple image references do not require a text prompt.

Q: --stop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter will stop your generation partway through.

In this example: `A field of flowers --stop 50`
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in a softer less detailed image.
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image.

Q: Does Midjourney know about this style, artist, movie, game, or media?

Midjourney has a wide variety of subjects and topics in its dataset. If you find it is unfamiliar with a topic you reference in your prompt, you may need to be more specific. You can also try to provide an image prompt, character reference, or style reference.

Q: What is chaos? What is --c? Why do I see prompts with s and c in them? What does c do?

The '--chaos' or '--c' parameter affects how different the images are from each other in the initial grid. The value goes from 0 to 100, 0 being the default.
In your settings, adjust the chaos value with the `Variety` slider.

Q: How do I get a full body picture? How do I get the whole person in the image? How do I get a full body shot?

Include a composition description, such as `full-length portrait` or `full body shot`, to indicate that you want to see the entire person. For more strength, describe the character from head to toe. Don’t forget to include its pose, or the bot will decide based on your image’s aspect ratio.
For example: `Full body shot of a man with short hair, running wearing boots`

Q: How do I specify a color in my prompt? Can I control color? Can I use CMYK? Can I use RGB? Can I use Pantone codes for colors? Can I use hex codes for color?

At the moment, Midjourney does not understand color codes. To specify a color or tones, use words.
For example: mauve purple, cobalt blue, or pastel colored, vibrant colored etc.

Q: How do I get text or words in an image? How can I add text to my images? Is it possible to get text on images? How do I get text in an image? How do I add words to the image? How to create text?

Add text to your image by typing it in "quotes". Make sure you’re using version 6 (current default version).
For example: `Sci-fi movie poster with title text "Aliens!"`
