## Plans

There are 2 plans: Basic and Standard. Both can add a **Private** Power option for 20$.

### Both Plans Offer:

- Monthly subscription. Will renew automatically after 30 days by default (which can be toggled off)
- 5 friend-invites (just type `/invite` in a bot channel or DM with the bot)
- The ability to DM (Direct Message) the Bot (your images will still be in the public gallery, unless you add `/private` to your subscription)
- New commercial terms (see updated #rules)
- The ability to purchase private-by-default mode by typing `/private`
- New premium features like Max-Upscale and Batch mode (coming soon)
- Fast mode. You can buy more 'fast' hours for 4$/hr by turning on incremental billing (use `/fast` to purchase fast hours).
- Once you've successfully upgraded you'll see a new "member" role on your Discord profile.
- Access to web app member gallery at [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

### Basic Membership ($10/month) Offers:

- Limited use (\~200 images / month)
- Fast mode only
- You can switch plans at any time under `/subscribe`. You will only pay the difference if you didn't use all of your credits.

### Standard Membership ($30/month) Offers:

- 15 gpu-hrs/month of 'fast' mode and unlimited gpu-hrs/month of 'relax' mode.
- Fast mode is enabled for new subscribers but you can switch between `/relax` or `/fast` at any time.

### Private Power Option

- All plans can work in Direct Messages (DMs) with the Midjourney Bot. The Private Power option also hides your images and prompts from the gallery.
- Private mode is still subject to the PG-13 rules of content generation however, and moderators will be alerted to violations in your prompts.

**If you have recently subscribed to Private Powers you will need to log out then back in on the website, to see the publish/unpublish buttons.**

### Incremental Billing

- Both plans can pay for more fast mode with incremental billing.
- You can set a '**spending limit**'. When you hit the spending limit it will stop you and ask you to set a new one.
- You can type `/info` at any time to see how much money you've spent.

**How to activate it:** Once you have exhausted the fast hours on your plan, you can get more by opting-in to incremental billing at a rate of $4 per GPU hour by using `/fast`. You will be asked to set a spending limit. Upon reaching that limit it will stop you and ask you to set a new one. You will only be charged for the amount of time used. You can type `/info` at any time to see how much you have currently used.

## Commercial Terms

Basically you can use unlimited images (of your own creation) for whatever you want, as long as you meet the following conditions:

1. Your account is essentially only used by you (we don't want large groups sharing single accounts).
2. If you are using our service for your work as an employee of a corporation with more than $1M/yr in revenue (and you want these terms) you MUST update to the 'corporate' plan via typing `/subscribe` and clicking "enterprise" (it is $50/mo paid annually).
3. if your project has anything to do with blockchain, you must pay a 20% royalty on revenue over $20k/mo.

Please keep in mind that these terms are beta and we will continue to iterate on them as the beta progresses. Read the complete terms in the Discord #rules channel.

## Cancellation or Changes

### Can I cancel my subscription plan?

You can cancel your subscription at any time but the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle. If you change your mind, you can un-cancel your plan before the end of the cycle.

### Can I change my subscription plan?

You can generally change your subscription at any time, effective immediately. Any remaining usage or time on `Private` will be credited to your new plan. Enterprise plans are not eligible for downgrades.
