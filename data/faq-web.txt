Q: How do I create variations? What is a variation? Vary subtle or strong? What is the difference between Vary subtle and strong?

Create variations of an image you made on Midjourney to generate new images based on it. Open your image, find `Vary` on the right side, and click the `Subtle` or `Strong` button. When you’re in the [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) space, hover over an image to get these buttons.
◆ Vary **Subtle**: Retains the basic composition and colors, creating four new images with slightly different details.
◆ Vary **Strong**: Creates four new interpretations of your prompt, while referencing elements of the original.

Q: What does the ↻ button do? What does the recycle symbol do? What does the arrow do? How can I submit the same job again? What is a reroll? What does rerolling do? What does the button with the arrows mean? What is Rerun? What does Rerun do? Can I rerun my prompt? How to rerun the same prompt?

In the [Create](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine) space, the `↻ Rerun` button resubmits your request to generate a new set of four images using the same prompt and parameters. It’s like telling the bot to try again.

Note: To modify your prompt before rerunning it, click the `🅃 Use` button next to `↻ Rerun`. This will send your full command to your creation bar, allowing you to edit it before submitting.

`Editor` allows you to select and regenerate specific parts of an image. Select the areas of your image that you want modified and, if you want, edit your prompt on the side to guide the modifications. If you do not see the `Editor` option, click on your image and in the `Creation Actions` menu, click on `More options` to show or hide additional options.

Note: A larger selection provides more room for changes, while a smaller selection may result in more subtle modifications.

# - TURBO -

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs in Turbo mode are generated up to four times faster but also **consume twice as much fast GPU time** as a typical Fast mode job. If Turbo mode can’t be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead. [Read more about GPU time and Speed modes](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32016412137741-GPU-Speed-Fast-Relax-Turbo)

The Personalization feature learns your preferences over time through images you've rated (on the [Rate Images](https://www.midjourney.com/personalize) page) and other users' images you've favorited.

Add the Personalize parameter `--p` at the end of your prompt to tailor the model to your preferences, or toggle `Personalize` to `On` in your settings for all new prompts to have it. Your personal code is automatically added after it. [Read more about Personalization](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32433330574221-Personalization)

If you want to influence the style with specific images, use them as a [Style Reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32180011136653-Style-Reference).

To use the [Personalization feature](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32433330574221-Personalization) you need to rate enough images for it to learn your preferences. Go to the [`Rank Images` page](https://www.midjourney.com/personalize), and select your favorite image between the two. If you're uncertain or don't like either, Press `→ Skip`.

You can see how many images you've rated at the top; the personalization feature will work once you have a ranking count of about 200 images. [Read more about Personalization](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32433330574221-Personalization)

# - IMAGE PROMPTS  -

Q: What does the --iw parameter do? What does the --iw comment do? What does --iw do?

Q: Reference image? Use photo as reference? How do I upload an image? How do I get an image link? How do I use my own image? How do I upload or use an image from my hard-drive for an image prompt? Image prompt? How can I attach an image? Can I use an image as a starting point? Can I use my images? Can I send images to the AI? Can I give an image to the AI? I've seen a few people using source images, how does this work? Can I use an image? My own photo? My own personal photo? Edit my image? Is there a way to upload an image and modify it based from a prompt? Is there a way to upload an image and modify it? /blend?

Click the image icon on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add images. You can use an image in three different ways; hover over it to select the option of your choice. Shift-click to select multiple options.
By default, an image is added as an [`Image Prompt`](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32040250122381-Image-Prompts) (icon: picture). Other ways to use an image are as a [`Style Reference`](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32180011136653-Style-Reference) (icon: paper clip) or as a [`Character Reference`](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32162917505293-Character-Reference) (icon: portrait).

Note: References are used as parameters, they cannot be used without a prompt.

%image=https://cdn.midjourney.com/u/ff03153e-6e8a-48b4-87d0-5acd0a123688/f1f3a3f09c8df1221cb74b25f38605813ca0215bef534fd990d823bd2c8082eb.png

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), you cannot assign a negative weight to an image prompt. The value for the image weight parameter `--iw` must be between 0 and 3.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called "init" images. "Init" images are not currently supported, you can not modify your own images through Midjourney.
You can click the image icon on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add images. However, these are used as prompts or references, not as a starting point.

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What’s the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

The maximum value for the image weight parameter (`--iw`) is 3.

%image=https://s.mj.run/SacTjDbYf0k

---

Q: Is there a way to mix two images? Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

Click the image icon on the left of the `Imagine…` textbox to add image references to your prompt. If you only use **one image**, you’ll need to add a text description. If you use **two or more images**, the bot will blend them. Adding a text description becomes optional.

Note: The following parameters have no effect on blends: Stylize, Chaos, Weird, Style Reference.

---

# - TEXT PROMPTS -

Q: Is it — or --? Is it - or - -?

To manually input a parameter, type a double hyphen with no space (`--`) followed by the parameter name. There should only be a space before the double hyphen and after the parameter name.
For example: `landscape --ar 3:2`

Note: You can use an em dash (`—`) instead of a double hyphen.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to blend different prompts. By adding a number right after the double colons, without a space, you can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result. If you don’t type a number, it uses the default value 1.
[Read more about Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32658968492557-Multi-Prompts-Weights)

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

Text prompts are not case-sensitive, while parameters are case-sensitive and must be entered using lowercase letters.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter? Are there any special punctuation characters? Is punctuation important?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), punctuation is interpreted similarly to natural language. Compose your text prompt as you would structure a sentence to describe an image.

Some characters have a specific function. **"Quotation marks"** indicate that the text enclosed within them should appear in the image. **Double hyphens (`--`) or an em dash (`—`)** are used to manually input a parameter.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Different versions of Midjourney have different limits. The current model, Version 6, is much better at understanding prompts, similarly to natural language. You can type a single word, emoji or character but you can also input full sentences, it’s up to you!

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt?

Your `Stylization` value might be too high, try lowering it.
`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
◆ Lower values will follow your prompt closely.
◆ Higher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

# - SEEDS -

Q: How do I get the seed that was used for an image? I can not find the seed? Can’t find the seed number? How can I find the seed? How do I retrieve the seed number of an image? How do I get the seed of an image? How can I see the image’s seed? How can I see the image seed? Where can I see the seed? How to get the seed number in the website UI? How to get the seed number? Where do I get the seed number? Where do I find the seed? Where is the seed? How can I know the seed of an image? Copy seed? How to find the seed here? How to view the seed of an image created by Midjourney? Can I get the seed of a job?

To find the seed number of a Midjourney image you created, open the image and in the dropdown menu, select `Copy` > `Seed`.

Note: Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency. You can only copy the seed of your own images.
[Read more about Seeds](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32604356340877-Seeds)

%image=https://cdn.midjourney.com/u/ff03153e-6e8a-48b4-87d0-5acd0a123688/922733d9c0dc25de4b8a84f42282191c643825cc2fc5c636d4c03e80f71f7892.png

---

Q: What does --seed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed? Seed?

Each set of four images made in Midjourney uses a random seed number as a starting point. To find your image’s seed number, open the dropdown menu, select `Copy` and `Seed`.

Use the `--seed` parameter, with a value between 0 and 4294967295, to give the bot a specific starting point. If you use the same seed and prompt as another image, the bot will produce an identical or very similar set of four images. This is useful when using similar prompts to test how the changes affect the result.

Note: Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency.
[Read more about Seeds](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32604356340877-Seeds)

---

# - STOP -

Q: --stop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter followed by a number between 10 and 100 will stop your generation partway through. It only works on your initial generation, not upscales or variations. For example, with the prompt `a baby red panda --stop 40`, the grid will stop at 40% through the process, resulting in a softer, less detailed image.
[Read more about Stop](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32602768934925-Stop)

---

# - CHAOS -

Q: What is chaos? What is --c? Why do I see prompts with s and c in them? What does c do? What is variety?

The variety parameter, also called chaos, affects how different the images are from each other in the initial grid. The value goes from 0 to 100, 0 being the default. In your settings, adjust the chaos value with the `Variety` slider.

Q: payment Error: zip code doesn’t match? Zip code error? Saying my zip code is wrong? My zip code is right? Saying my zip code is wrong but it’s not?

Go to your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account) and click on the `Edit Billing` button. Add your card details as an *entirely new* payment method, and use the `…` button to set it as your new default payment method.

Please email billing@midjourney.com for further assistance.

Q: payment Error: user missing a default payment method in stripe? Default payment? Default payment method?

To solve this bug, go to your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account) and click on the `Edit Billing` button.

When you get to the new page, look for the `...` button next to your payment method and click it, then press make default.

Please email billing@midjourney.com for further assistance.

Q: Error: The PaymentMethod provided (link) is not allowed for this PaymentIntent? Link payment error?

This error occurs when your default payment method has been linked from Stripe instead of entered manually. To fix it, go to your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account) and click on the `Edit Billing` button.

When you get to the new page, look for the `Add a payment method` and re-enter your card details manually, without using any auto-fill. Once you see your card information with an expiration date instead of the stylized `link` text, click the `…` next to it and select `Make default`.

Please email billing@midjourney.com for further assistance.

If your job fails, go to your [`Create` page](https://midjourney.com/imagine) and hover over the `Creation Failed` message to see more details about the error. Try signing out and back in.
If the problem continues or if you get a unique trace with three words, click `Report Bug` at the bottom left and send us a report explaining the issue.

---

Q: Is there a list of banned words? Where can I see the banned words?

The current Midjourney models do not use a banned word list. Rather, the bot attempts to parse the context of the prompt. Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it. Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

---

Q: AI moderator thinks this is against community standards? Banned prompt? My prompt was blocked? Prompt blocked for no reason? Prompt flagged by AI moderator? Why is Trump blocked? Why is Biden blocked?

Our bot filter considers your prompt or its context to be against our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32013696484109-Community-Guidelines). Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it.
Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

The filter is regularly updated. During certain times or events, it may restrict creating specific people or situations to prevent images from being used for political campaigns or misleading information.

---

Q: This happens on repeated or serious violations? You have been blocked from accessing?

Bans will not be discussed in this chat. You can email billing@midjourney.com for questions about your subscription status.

---

Q: Bot down? Status? Is the bot down? What's the best avenue for reporting issues? Is the server down?

If you are experiencing jobs not starting, or long wait times, click `Help` in the bottom left. If your issue is not listed in `Server Status`, please send us a report explaining the issue.

---

Q: Can’t use with only a single image prompt? Single image prompt with no text? Only a single image prompt? Only one image in prompt?

If you want to use just one image reference, you must include a text prompt with it. Prompts with multiple image references do not require a text prompt.

---

Q: Why is my image saying blocked by image filter? Request cancelled due to image filters? Image denied, request cancelled due to image filters? Anyone else getting "Image denied Request cancelled due to image filters”? Why is my image blocked by image filter? An image in your prompt was denied, please try again with a different image? It is denying the use of my own images?

To prevent abuse and content against our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32013696484109-Community-Guidelines), images in prompts have an extra cautious filter. It doesn't necessarily mean the images are against our Community Guidelines, but to be safe, they can't be used for prompts. You can edit the image or use text instead.
Here are some things to avoid in image prompts: shirtless characters (regardless of their gender), cleavage or too much visible skin, nude or skin tone clothing. 

Note: The origin of the image does not matter. Every image is filtered the same way, whether it's a famous image or an image created by Midjourney itself.
The filter is automated and can occasionally misinterpret the content.

Q: Does Midjourney know about this style, artist, movie, game, or media?

Midjourney has a wide variety of subjects and topics in its dataset. If you find it is unfamiliar with a topic you reference in your prompt, you may need to be more specific. You can also try to provide an [image prompt](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32040250122381-Image-Prompts), [character reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32162917505293-Character-Reference), or [style reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32180011136653-Style-Reference).

Q: How do I get a full body picture? How do I get the whole person in the image? How do I get a full body shot? What should be added to contain the upper body and head in the photo?

Include a composition description, such as `full-length portrait` or `full body shot`, to indicate that you want to see the entire person. For more strength, describe the character from head to toe. Don’t forget to include its pose, or the bot will decide based on your image’s aspect ratio.
For example: `Full body shot of a man with short hair, running wearing boots`

Q: Why can’t I make a very realistic result? I ask for realistic but it doesn’t look real? How to make realistic?

If you want an image which looks like a picture, make sure to prompt for a `photo`, or `photography` and use photographic terms. **Do not** use words such as `photorealistic` or `3D`.

Q: How do I specify a color in my prompt? Can I control color? Can I use CMYK? Can I use RGB? Can I use Pantone codes for colors? Can I use hex codes for color? Can I use an exact color value? How to use a color value? How to use color code?

At the moment, Midjourney does not understand color codes. To specify a color or tones, use words. For example: mauve purple, cobalt blue, or pastel colored, vibrant colored etc.

Q: How do I get text or words in an image? How can I add text to my images? Is it possible to get text on images? How do I get text in an image? How do I add words to the image? How to create text?

Add text to your image by typing it in "quotes". Make sure you’re using version 6.1 (current default version). For example: `Sci-fi movie poster with title text "Aliens!"`
