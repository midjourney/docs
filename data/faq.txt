Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons? What does U and V do? What is U1-4, V1-4? 

**U** UPSCALE: The Uüî¢ buttons separate your chosen image from the grid, giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.

**V** VARIATION: The Vüî¢ buttons create 4 [variations](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32692978437005-Variations) of the selected image while keeping the style and composition.

Clicking on U doesn't use GPU time in the current version 7 but upscales creative and subtle consume several GPU minutes. [Read more about upscales](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32804058614669-Upscalers)
Variations use GPU time.

Q: How do I upscale? What is an upscale? 

Click on Uüî¢ buttons to separate an image from the grid and get options to modify this image. *This does not use any GPU time.*

You can then **upscale the image to double the size**. *This uses about double the GPU time used to create a grid.*
üîπ `Upscale (Subtle)` is the closest match to the original image.
üîπ `Upscale (Creative)` adds the most detail when upscaling an image.
Running the upscale again will give you a different result.

Q: What is a variation? How do I create variations?

Click on Vüî¢ buttons under a grid, or `Vary` (subtle or strong) under a single image, to generate new images based on it. 
üîπ `Vary (Subtle)` retains the basic composition and colors, creating four new images with slightly different details.
üîπ `Vary (Strong)` creates four new interpretations of your prompt, while referencing elements of the original.

**Note:** Use the command </settings:1000850743479255081> to set the variation strength used for Vüî¢ buttons.

Q: What is GPU time? What is a GPU minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms of the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query? Do upscales cost GPU time? Do variations use GPU time?

Similar to credits, generating images and videos uses GPU time. How long you wait in ‚Äúreal life time‚Äù does not affect how much GPU time is consumed.
With the default settings:
- `/imagine`: consumes about 1 GPU minute
- Variations: consume slightly less GPU time
- Grid Upscales: split the existing grid, they cost no extra GPU time
- Creative/Subtle Upscale: consumes about 2 GPU minutes
- Videos: consume 8 GPU minutes

**Note:** Jobs with an [Omni Reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/36285124473997-Omni-Reference) run in turbo mode, which consumes double the GPU time.
The above costs are based on the default version (7), using older versions may use more GPU.

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode uses a dynamic queuing system that resets with each of your monthly time renewal.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight? Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while? What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before? Relax mode is running slower?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

Q: Failed to submit: Relax queues are only available for users with a standard plan or higher? Relax queues are only available for users? Relax on Basic? I have basic but Relax queues are not available? Why I cannot use relax? Relax mode says you must have a Standard plan or higher? I had relax on Basic but now it's off?

Can I use relax with Basic? I have my subscription but cannot use Relax? It says it is not possible in relax mode? I cannot activate Relax?  

The [Basic plan](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/27870484040333-Comparing-Midjourney-Plans) includes a limited amount of generations, with 200 GPU minutes of fast time per month. Turn on Fast mode with the command </fast:972289487818334212> to create images.
**Run out of fast time ?** You can buy and win extra GPU hours, or upgrade your plan to continue generating.

*The special Relaxathon event temporarily allowed all members to generate unlimited speedy images in Relax mode. This event has now ended, so all subscriptions have returned to their regular limits and perks.*

---

Q: You can not submit batch jobs in relax mode?

Batch jobs ([permutations](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32761322355597-Permutations) and [repeat](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32757107922061-Repeat)) only work in Fast mode. *The special Relaxathon event temporarily allowed all members to generate unlimited speedy images in Relax mode.

# - FAST -

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours? 

There are three Speed modes to generate images. Use the commands `/relax`, `/fast` or `/turbo` to select the speed you want:
üîπ **Relax** mode adds your job to a dynamic queue, it can be slower but is unlimited.
üîπ **Fast** mode starts your image right away but uses your limited GPU fast time.
üîπ **Turbo** mode starts your job right away and processes it as fast as possible but consumes twice as much GPU time as in Fast mode.

Each plan comes with a limited amount of monthly GPU fast time. You can buy more on [your account page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) on the website.
The Basic plan does not include access to Relax mode. Relax mode for videos is only available on the Pro and Mega plans.

# - TURBO -

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs in Turbo mode are generated up to four times faster but also **consume twice as much fast GPU time** as a typical Fast mode job.

Switch to Turbo mode with the command `/turbo` or select ‚ö°Turbo mode in your </settings:1000850743479255081>.

**Note:** If Turbo mode can‚Äôt be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print them out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution? How do I increase my image‚Äôs resolution? How can i make a 4k resolution? How do I make the quality higher? How do I get higher quality images?

For square images in the current version, the upscalers will produce the following:
A grid upscale: 1024x1024 px
A (Creative) and (Subtle) Upscale: 2048 x 2048 px

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.
If you need larger or higher resolution images, you can look into 3rd party upscale softwares.

**Note:** Rolling a (Creative) or (Subtle) upscale another time will still produce a 2048 x 2048 px result.

The default value of the `--stylize` parameter is 100. You can adjust it by adding the `--s` parameter at the end of your prompt with a value from 0 to 1000.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

# - RAW -

Q: Raw style? --raw? --style raw? Raw? Raw mode?

Similar to how a photographer captures a raw image and then edits it to reflect their own aesthetic, images are generated by default with Midjourney's "style". You can control how much influence it has using the [`--stylize` parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32196176868109-Stylize). If you prefer a more neutral result, use the `--raw` parameter to remove most of Midjourney's default style.

**Note:** The less influence Midjourney's aesthetic has, the more important your prompt becomes. Make sure your prompt is a detailed and specific visual description of the image you want.

# - CHARACTER REFERENCE -

Q: How to have the same character made but in different scenes? Can I keep the same character in my images? Is there an option to keep the same character? How to use --cref? Can I add a character reference? How to get consistent characters? Where can I see how to have consistent characters? How do i use the same avatar?

Use the Character Reference parameter `--cref` followed by a space and a link to your image for the characters in your results to be based on a specific image. You can add multiple links to have multiple character references, make sure to have a space between each link.
You can add text, image prompts, and other parameters to guide the results.
For example: `Short blond man holding a puppy --cref https://pic1.png https://pic2.png`

**Note: Character references only work in Version 6.0 and 6.1**. In [Version 7](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32199405667853-Version#h_01JQSR0Q6H0AX8NCC8QGE6C2NZ), use the [Omni Reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/36285124473997-Omni-Reference) parameter `--oref`.

Q: What is cw? --cw?

The character weight parameter `--cw` adjusts how much information is used in your character reference. *You can only use the character weight parameter if you have a character reference.*

`--cw 100` is the default and maximum value; it uses all of the information, from head to toe. Lowering the value gradually shifts focus from the full body to the face.

Can I personalize my style? Can I personalise my style? How do I get my personal code? Where do I find my personal code? Where do I find my --p code? Can I train my own model?

The [Personalization](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32433330574221-Personalization) feature learns your preferences over time through images you've rated (on the [Rate Images](https://www.midjourney.com/personalize) page) and other users' images you've favorited.
Add the Personalize parameter `--p` at the end of your prompt to tailor the model to your preferences. Your personal code is automatically added after it.

**Note:** You can adjust the strength of your personal styling by combining it with the [`--stylize` parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32196176868109-Stylize), with a value from 0 to 1000. A higher `--s` value will show your styling more but may dismiss some specifics of your prompt. 

If you want to influence the style with your own image(s), use the [Style Reference parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32180011136653-Style-Reference).

---

Q: Can I use someone else's personal style parameter? Can I use someone else's --p code? Can others user my personal code? Can others user my --p code? Can other members use my personalize code? Can other members user my personalise code?

# - TEXT PROMPTS -

Q: Is it ‚Äî or --? Is it - or - -?

To manually input a parameter, type a double hyphen with no space (`--`) followed by the parameter name. There should only be a space before the double hyphen and after the parameter name.
For example: `landscape --ar 3:2`

**Note:** You can use an em dash (`‚Äî`) instead of a double hyphen.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to blend different prompts. By adding a number right after the double colons, without a space, you can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result. The default weight value is 1.
In this example: `space:: ship::2`
The prompt `space` has the default weight value of 1 while the prompt `ship` has a weight value of 2, giving it twice as much influence.

**Note:** Multi-prompts work with model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, Niji 4, 5, Niji 5, 6, Niji 6, and 6.1.

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts? How should I write my prompts?  What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts? Do prompts have an order? Does word order matter? Does word sequence matter? Is there a template for prompts?

[Here is a guide on effective text prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32023408776205-Prompt-Basics)

---

Q: Setting language? Can I change to a different language? Can I use it in another language? Can I use a different language?

Text prompts work best in English but some words in other languages can be understood. If you use Niji, you can type text in English, Korean, Japanese, or Chinese.
To change the language your Discord app is displayed in, [follow this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216406447-How-can-I-change-Discord-s-Language).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

Text prompts are not case-sensitive, while parameters are case-sensitive and must be entered using lowercase letters.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 7), punctuation is interpreted similarly to natural language. Compose your text prompt as you would structure a sentence to describe an image.

Some characters have a specific function:
üîπ "Quotation marks" indicate that the text enclosed within them should appear in the image.
üîπ Double hyphens (`--`) or an em dash (`‚Äî`) are used to manually input a parameter.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Different versions of Midjourney have different limits. The current model, Version 7, is much better at understanding prompts, similarly to natural language. You can type a single word, emoji or character but you can also input full sentences, it‚Äôs up to you!

[Read more about prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32023408776205-Prompt-Basics)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your `stylize` parameter value might be too high, try lowering it.
Stylization adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt. 
The default value of the `--stylize` parameter is 100. You can adjust it by adding the `--s` parameter at the end of your prompt with a value from 0 to 1000.
üîπ Lower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπ Higher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

---

Q: What about ‚ÄúUnreal engine‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúArtstation‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúOctane render‚Äù?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

# - NO -

Q: Negative prompt? --no parameter?

Add the `--no` parameter followed by a space and a list of elements you do not want in your image.
For example: `a bowl of fruits --no citrus, table`

**Note:** The bot will try to exclude each individual word in your list. So avoid elements which include `clothes` or `clothing`.

Q: What does --seed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed?

Each set of four images made in Midjourney uses a random seed number as a starting point.
Use the `--seed` parameter, with a value between 0 and 4294967295, to give the bot a specific starting point.
If you use the same seed and prompt as another image, the bot will produce an identical or very similar set of four images. This is useful when using similar prompts to test how the changes affect the result.

To find an image‚Äôs seed number, open your image in [your archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) and in the image menu, click on `Copy` > `Seed`. You can only copy the seed of your own images.

# - STOP -

Q: ‚Äìstop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter followed by a number between 10 and 100 will stop your generation partway through. 100 is the default value.

In this example: `/imagine prompt: a baby red panda --stop 50`
The grid will stop halfway (50%) through the process, resulting in a softer, less detailed image.

**Note:** The stop parameter works with model Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, Niji 4, 5, Niji 5, 6, Niji 6, and 6.1. It does not work when upscaling an image.

If you are getting an error, try restarting Discord, updating it, or reinstalling it.

---

Q: Channel verification level is too high? Channel verification? Verification too high? Email verification? Verification error?

We require that you verify the email address attached to your Discord account in order to use Midjourney. You can learn how to do that [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6181726888215).

---

Q: Embeds?

If the bot is only showing you buttons or a completely empty message, update your Discord settings:
Discord Settings :gear: > `Chat` > Toggle ON `Show embeds and preview website links pasted into chat`

%image=https://cdn.midjourney.com/u/d6f915c1-a3b1-425d-9934-3fb714cd8b7b/b2d4915b0c21461c1887c62c54ee73d6432ab322de82ad4fa229aaa49e79509d.png

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1259116844430655488/1259121654534111242/HowToDM.gif

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"? I get an error when I try to create a thread?

Discord allows this server a maximum number of active threads. When older threads are archived, you can create a new thread. Until space becomes available, you can work in Direct Messages with the Bot or invite the Bot to your server.

---

Q:  Submission error, unexpected token? SyntaxError in Vary (region)? "is not valid JSON"? Unexpected token when using Vary (region)? Invalid JSON?

The [Vary (Region)](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32794723105549-Vary-Region) feature has certain limitations:
üîπ You cannot use it to edit images created with an [Omni reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/36285124473997-Omni-Reference) (`--oref`). You can only use the website's [Editor](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32764383466893-Editor) for these images.
üîπ You cannot use [custom parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32868982949517-Creation-Settings-in-Discord#h_01JFGHS2KP8XMH13FP8DFV5Y1D).

Make sure all parameters and links in your prompt are valid. If the issue persists, the moderation filter may be blocking the edit. Try using the website's [Editor](https://www.midjourney.com/editor/new) for a more specific error.

**Note:** Removing the `--oref` parameter from the original prompt will still give an error. The Editor is the only alternative.

---

Q: I can‚Äôt accept ToS? Can‚Äôt accept ToS? How to accept ToS? I can‚Äôt accept Terms? How to accept Terms? How to accept ToS? I can‚Äôt accept terms of service? How do I accept the terms? How do I accept terms? How do I accept ToS?

A green button to accept the [Terms of Service](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32083055291277-Terms-of-Service) should appear when you first use the command `/imagine`.
Use the official Discord app and try several times if you don't see the TOS button or get an error accepting it.

üñ•Ô∏è**PC/Mac**  Do a hard restart of Discord with `Alt+F4` or `‚åò+Q`.
üì± **Mobile** `Update` the Discord app. If that doesn‚Äôt work, `reinstall` the Discord app.

---

Q: What does progress images have been disabled mean? What does process images have been disabled mean?

In-progress images are sometimes disabled temporarily for performance reasons. Do not worry! Final results will still be sent normally when the generation is complete.

---

Q: Bot down? Status? Is the bot down? 

You can check our [**status page**](https://status.midjourney.com/) and read the  <#942231458918064148> channel for updates.

If you‚Äôre experiencing an issue not covered on the status page or channel, reach out for help in [#support](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/958069758211797092).

---

Q: Cannot use --version 7 with only a single image prompt? Only a single image prompt? Please add another image prompt, or a text prompt?

If you want to use just one image reference, you must include a text prompt with it. Prompts with multiple image references do not require a text prompt.

For example: `https://pic1.png a cool person flying like superman`

---

Q: --stylize must be between 0 and 1000 with --version 7? stylize must be between 0 and 1000?

Use the command </settings:1000850743479255081> and select `Style Med` to use the Version‚Äôs default value for Stylize.

`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
üîπ Lower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπ Higher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32196176868109-Stylize)

**Are you on the [Midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine)?** [Click here to learn how to navigate the Create Page](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/33390732264589-Creating-on-Web)

---

Q: My images won't finish? Stops at 93%? 93% bug? Stops at 62%? 62% bug?

In some cases, the bot may fail to return the finished image in Discord. You can find the finished image in [your gallery](https://midjourney.com/archive) on the Midjourney website.

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [command `/show`](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32635695384461-Show-Command) followed by the job ID.

---

Q: 504 Deadline Exceeded?

If you get the error ‚Äú504 Deadline Exceeded‚Äù when trying to use the command `/describe`, it means the image file you are uploading is too large. Use a smaller image and try again.

# - MODERATION -
# -----------------

Q: You have been blocked from accessing Midjourney. This happens on repeated or serious ToS violations? My account shows "You have been blocked from accessing Midjourney. This happens on repeated or serious ToS violations", please help me? You have been blocked from accessing Midjourney?

Bans will not be discussed in this chat. You can email billing@midjourney.com for questions about your subscription status.

---

Q: Is there a list of banned words? Where can I see the banned words?

The current Midjourney models do not use a banned word list. Rather, the bot attempts to parse the context of the prompt. Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it. Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

---

Q: Why is my image saying blocked by image filter? Request cancelled due to image filters? Image denied, request cancelled due to image filters? My image was denied?

To prevent abuse and content against our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32013696484109-Community-Guidelines), images in prompts have an extra cautious filter. It doesn't necessarily mean the images are against our Community Guidelines, but to be safe, they can't be used for prompts.
Here are some things to avoid in image prompts:
üîπ Shirtless characters (regardless of their gender or species)
üîπ Cleavage or too much visible skin
üîπ Nude or skin tone clothing
You can adjust the image or use text instead. Ask our [#prompt-craft](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713) community if you have trouble finding the right words.

**Note:** The origin of the image does not matter. Every image is filtered the same way, whether it's an uploaded image or an image created by Midjourney itself.
The filter is automated and can occasionally misinterpret the content.

---

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing?

Some jobs may be temporary on Discord when using certain words or phrases in your prompt. The images are only visible to you and disappear when you close, refresh, or switch Discord pages. If the job is ephemeral, you‚Äôll see the text `Only you can see this` at the bottom of the bot's message.

Don't worry, all these images are in [your archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) on the Midjourney website. To bring them back on Discord:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the image in the [Organize](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) tab on the website and copy the job ID.
2Ô∏è‚É£ In Discord, type the [command `/show`](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32635695384461-Show-Command) and paste the job ID.

**Note:** This does not happen when you create images in your [Direct Messages](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32637339216013-Discord-Direct-Messages) with the bot.

---

Q: How do I get a full body picture? How do I get the whole person in the image? How do I get a full body shot?

Include a composition description, such as `full-length portrait` or `full body shot`, to indicate that you want to see the entire person. For more strength, describe the character from head to toe. Don‚Äôt forget to include its pose, or the bot will decide based on your image‚Äôs aspect ratio.
For example: `Full body shot of a man with short hair, running wearing boots`

Q: How do I specify a color in my prompt? Can I control color? Can I use CMYK? Can I use RGB? Can I use Pantone codes for colors? Can I use hex codes for color?

At the moment, Midjourney does not understand color codes. To specify a color or tones, use words.
For example: mauve purple, cobalt blue, or pastel colored, vibrant colored etc.

[Add text to your image](https://docs.midjourney.com/hc/en-us/articles/32502277092109-Text-Generation) by typing it in "quotes". This currently works better with Version 6.1.
For example: `Sci-fi movie poster with title text "Aliens!" --v 6.1`

---

Q: Why do I get text on my image? How do I avoid titles text? Every image has text, what to do? All my images have watermarks? Why is my prompt written on the image?
