# -------------------- ----BASICS----- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- --INTERFACE- --------------------

Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons?

U is upscale, V is variation (compositionally similar image)
1  2
3  4

---

Q: What does the ↻ button do? How can I submit the same job again?

The ↻ submits the same job again, which will run with a different seed. You will see more variations.

---


# -------------------- ---IMAGINE----- --------------------

Q: I'm having trouble using the bot - how do I use /imagine? How do I use /imagine? How do I generate images? How to use it? How do I use the bot? How does the bot work? So just /imagine [prompt] ? I type the prompts and nothing appears. How I use? I type the prompts and nothing appears? Imagine? How do I make art? How do I use midjourney? How do I prompt? how can i ask the ai to create img? How do I trial the program? How do I get started? how can i start using the midjourny as a free user? /image? /imagine?

See the [Quick Start Guidel](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/) for the basics.

In any #newbies channel you can see, type /imagine and then your prompt:
When you type `/imagine` try clicking on the box that pops up that says "prompt". It should say `/imagine` prompt then type what you want. See the image below

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961148616884506674/969225978356326470/ImaginePrompt.gif

If you don't see the `/imagine` option, update your Discord app, re-log-in, and check your subscription. 

---

Q: Why don’t I see the /imagine option as a slash command? I don’t see /imagine in my slash commands? My commands don’t work? Imagine doesn't work for me? I type the prompts and nothing appears. I type /imagine and nothing happens.

Especially on mobile, you may need to update the app (via the app store etc) and restart it. Then try the / prompt in a bot channel and see if the `/imagine` option is listed. Otherwise, is your account subscription active? Try `/info` to see your status.

---

Q: What's a bot channel? Where can I use imagine? Where can I use /subscribe? Where can I use /info? Where can I make an image?

A bot channel is any channel where you can use a Midjourney bot command like /imagine /subscribe or /info. You can generate images with the /imagine command in any channel marked as "Image Generation" channels. 

---

Q: Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms for the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job?

Yes each action counts as a generation but each type of action takes a different amount of time so can cost more or less. With the default size, variations take around 20 seconds, upscales take around 70 seconds and rerolls/imagines take 60 seconds.

---

Q: Is it possible to edit a prompt without restarting? 

It is not possible to edit or change a prompt at this time.

---



# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------GPU------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a gpu minute?

We try to track usage in terms of compute-time. One GPU-minute is roughly the amount it takes to do 1 /imagine query, 4 variations, one upscale, or 0.7 max-upscales.

---

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left? How do I see how much I have used? How do I see how many hours I have left? Where can I check how many prompts I have left? How many images can I make? How can I see my queue? Where do I check my jobs? How do I check how many jobs I have left?

Use `/info` in a bot channel to check your subscription status and usage.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

Q: What is relax mode? Why was it faster before? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours? Relax Time?

We have two modes for image generation, “fast” and “relax”. Fast tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's our highest priority processing tier, and it's kinda expensive. “Relax” puts you in a queue behind others based on how much you’ve used the system.

Right now, we give 15 gpu-hours/mo of ‘fast’ with the ‘Standard’ plan, 200 gpu-minutes/mo with the ‘Basic’ plan and 120 gpu-hours/yr with the ‘Corporate’ plan.

One hour is roughly 60 image generation or upscale commands and roughly 200 image variation commands.

---

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?

At any time you can type /relax to enter relax mode, or /fast to toggle out of it. Remember, in relax mode your image generations don't count towards your monthly quota of ‘fast’ images.

Please note: The ‘Basic’ plan does not include relax mode. Relax mode also doesn't support max-upscample commands.

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes it does, relax mode is based on a dynamic queueing system that resets every time your subscription renews. 

---

Q: My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed? All my submissions are "relaxed", when can I have fast uploads again?

Use `/fast` in a bot channel. This will enable fast generation, but you will be incrementally charged for each image if you are out of fast credits after setting a billing threshold. You will not be charged without first setting a spending limit. Your fast time automatically renews every 30 days when your subscription does. 

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight. Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while.  What is the average wait time?

Relaxed times vary based on a number of factors. Relaxed times are generally under 5 minutes but sometimes can be under a minute or closer to 15 minutes.

---


# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast-hours mean? Fast time?

We have two modes for image generation, “fast” and “relax”. Fast tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's our highest priority processing tier. “Relax” puts you in a queue behind others based on how much you’ve used the system. 

Right now, we give 15 gpu-hours/mo of ‘fast’ with the ‘Standard’ plan and 200 gpu-minutes/mo with the ‘Basic’ plan.

One hour is roughly 60 image generation or upscale commands and roughly 200 image variation commands.

These numbers are experimental and may change at any time.

---

Q: What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? 

You can set a spending limit and buy it at $4/gpu-hour. 

This cost will be billed incrementally and charged either at the end of the month or every time you hit a billing threshold (the monthly price of your base plan). 

Hourly prices are experimental and subject to change.

---

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? 

Fast hours do not roll over month to month

---

Q: My images say "metered, fast"?

Use `/relax` in a bot channel. This will cost you nothing but images will take longer to generate.

---

Q: How do I enable the additional fast time? 

Use the /fast command after running out of your monthly fast hours to approve metered billing and set a spending limit for additional fast hours at $4/gpu-hour. 




# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- ----INVITES----- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is a "friend pass"? How many invites do I have? How do I see my invites? How can I get more invitations? When do I get more invites?

Invites were a part of the closed beta. We are now in open beta and you can use this link to invite someone:
https://discord.gg/midjourney

---

Q: Do invites expire? My invite link was invalid.

Invites were a part of the closed beta. We are now in open beta and you can use this link to invite someone:
https://discord.gg/midjourney

---

Q: Can I invite someone to this server? How do I generate an invite? How can I invite someone? How can I use friend pass? Do I have an invite code? How can I use one of the invitations?

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- ------TRIAL----- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Even if the trial expires, do we remain in the discord? Even if the trial expires, do we remain part of the discord server?

Yes, you will remain in the discord server.

---

Q: Do trials reset monthly? Do I get more free images every month? Do I get free images every day? How many images do I get as a free user? Do trials reset monthly? Does my free trial renew? Is my trial a limited number per day or overall? How long is the trial? How many images can we do with the Trial Version? How many images can you generate with the basic trial? How many images does trial have? How many images does trial have?

To expand the community sustainably, we're giving everyone a limited trial, and then several options to buy a full membership.

Each new user gets a free-trial of around 25 images. This trial can be used over multiple days and doesn't presently expire.

---

Q: Why isn’t this free? Do I really have to pay for this? Can you give me free access? No free?

Midjourney does not provide a free tier because of the sheer cost involved with using farms of hundreds to thousands of GPUs. As it is, we don’t make much profit on our paid plans, and we cannot afford to provide a free tier to users at this time because we don’t have the resources to do so. Please note that the free trial is a one-time allocation of 25 GPU minutes, and creating alternate accounts to take advantage of the trial multiple times **WILL** result in a ban.

---


# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- SUBSCRIPTION --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Do subscriptions renew on the first of the month? When does my subscription renew?

Subscriptions renew every 30 days. You can check when this is by using `/info`

---

Q: How do I subscribe? How to subscribe? How do I become a member? /subscribe? How does one become a member? How can I be a full member?  How can I subscribe to it? how to get paid version? How do you get a subscription? How can I upgrade from the trial version? hello, where can I can make the payment for the Standard plan? And how do i buy the 10$ plan? How do I buy?

Type `/subscribe` and click the link provided or go to [https://www.midjourney.com/account/](https://www.midjourney.com/account/)

---

Q: How much for a subscription? Where can I see plans? What’s the difference between Basic and Standard? How much does an unlimited plan cost? 

%image=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984460137475497985/996112315684491354/plans.png
[Subscription page on a website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/)

---

Q: Can I pay with PayPal? Can I use PayPal? Do you have other payment methods? Paypal PayPal? Do I have to use a credit card? Are there other ways to pay? Is there another way to pay for a subscription other than with a credit card? 

Only payment methods that work with Stripe are currently supported

---

Q: Are the payments lifetime or monthly? Is the subscription price paid per month?

Subscription prices are monthly. Any benefit of the membership (ie: X images a month) are replenished monthly.

---

Q: Will a yearly subscription become available? 

There are no current plans for yearly basic or standard subscriptions

---



# -------------------- METERED --------------------
Q: if we go over our limit of fast hours does it let us know? or just start billing for the extra hourly time with no warning? If I use up minutes, can I get more without paying? Can you accidently get a big bill?

When you run out of fast credits, you will be prompted to either set a spending limit or move to relax mode. Incremental billing is optional and is only enabled if you explicitly set a spending limit. You will not be able to use incremental billing without first setting a spending limit. If you have a standard membership you can continue to make images in relax-mode by typing /relax.

---

Q: Where do we set a billing limit? Where do we set a spending limit?

You can only set a billing limit after you run out of fast time. Once you do you will be prompted to set a spending limit. If that prompt doesn’t come up you can use `/fast` to receive it. You will not be able to use incremental billing without first setting a spending limit. 

---


# -------------------- CANCELATION --------------------

Q: How can I cancel? How can I cancel my plan? How do I unsubscribe? How can I cancel my subscription? How to cancel a subscription? Where do I cancel my subsription?

You can cancel your subscription by heading over to [our 
website](https://midjourney.com/account), or by typing “/subscribe” and following the link

On the website underneath 'View details & invoices' you can click `Cancel Plan`

You are free to cancel your subscription at any time but the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle. So all the benefits and fast time will remain until the end of this cycle. If you change your mind, you can un-cancel your plan before the end of the cycle.

---

Q: When I unsubscribe will I still have access to my website gallery? If I cancel will I still be able to see my images on the gallery? If I cancel my subscription can I still see my images?

Yes you can continue to access your online gallery of images even if you're not currently a paid member.

---


# -------------------- PRIVATE --------------------

Q: How does upgrading to private work? How much does it cost to upgrade to private?

Private costs 20$ extra per month. If you upgrade to /private the cost may be reduced for the first month depending on how far you are through your billing cycle (if you are 50% of the way through it will cost 50% as much)

---


# -------------------- SWITCH PLANS --------------------

Q: If I want to switch plans will I be charged the full amount? What if I go from basic plan to standard? Can I change my plan? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference?

If you go from basic to standard, your percentage of remaining gpu-time / images will be deducted from your 30$ upgrade.

---


# -------------------- TRANSFER --------------------

Q: Can I transfer my subscription to another account? I used the wrong account? I subscribed with the wrong account?

We don’t currently transfer subscriptions between accounts, but what we can do is once you subscribe on the correct account we can cancel your other subscription and add a credit for 1 month on your new account.

---

Q: Can I switch plans? If I switch to Standard it will be 20$ or 30$ ?

If you used all your time in Basic -> Standard still will cost you 30$.
If you used half of the Basic time -> it will be 25$
And so on 
If you used none of the Basic time -> it will be 20$
---

Q: Is it paid to make images? Aw I need to pay? Do I need to pay?

We give new guests a free trial of roughly 25 images. After that they can purchase a paid membership for more.

---


# -------------------- QUEUE --------------------

Q: How many jobs can be generating at once? How many jobs can I line up? How long is the queue? How many concurrent jobs can I run? How many can I queue?

You can have 3 jobs going at once (of any kind, 2x2, upscale etc). If you submit a 4th job or more, you will get a message and your job will be started as soon as another one finishes

You can start 10 jobs before your queue is full. If you are in relax mode this decreases to 2 concurrent images at once.

---





# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- ----PRIVATE---- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? What if I don’t want my images to appear in the gallery?

We are building a open-by-default community focused on collective exploration and fun. If you have a need to opt-out of this and be private-by-default you can upgrade your plan for an additional $20/mo at any time by typing /private or by purchasing a ‘Corporate’ plan if you are part of a larger company.

---

Q: What's the 50$ plan? How do I hide my images? What's private mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images. How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts. How do I go private? There is no $50 monthly plan though?

Use `/private` to either activate or purchase private powers. This will make your images private and hidden from the website, but costs more. It's a subscription upgrade that is available to either plan.

You must generate in DMs for your images to be completely private. Even with `/private` enabled, images you generate in public channels will be visible to other users of that channel.

---





# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- UPSCALE & SIZE --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: How do I change my aspect ratio? How can I specify image width? How can I specify image height? How can I change the dimensions? How to make not square images? What is the prompt for width and height?

To change the aspect ratio of your image use the --ar 3:4 parameter (or your desired aspect ratio).  It should look like this:
/imagine prompt: cyberpunk cats --ar 2:3 See the [User Manual](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#sizes), for more information.

---

Q How can I prevent preview and upscale to add too much details? The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

You can use `--stop 80` and replace `80` with the % you want to stop at. Use `--uplight` for the upscale to add less details, or redo it with the button "Light Upscale Redo" afterwards. Or you can react to your image with :envelope: and it will send you the separate images in DM. Then change the resolution using a program on your computer.

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? 

This feature is only available in /fast mode and when --w and --h are under 512. And sometimes it’s already at almost max resolution after the first one.

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale?

Light upscale uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the –uplight switch in a prompt, or hit the “light upscale redo” button under upscaled images.

---

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print it out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher?

Upscale is about 1024x1024 and max is about 1664x1664. Assuming square images. The max file size is ~3.3m
for a 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratio image, regular upscale is 1024x1792, max upscale is 1152x2048. Maximum you can get around 2.8 megapixels.

More information about image size and resolution is available [on this page](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/understanding-image-size)

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- PARAMETERS --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Is there documentation? Where can I find all the commands? Is there documentation? Is there an exhaustive list of arguments somewhere we can look at? Where can I find a reference of the various parameters for imagine? What are all the suffixes I can use? Can anyone help me with the commands syntax please? Can I have the user manual? Where do I find documentation? 

Yes, you are definitely should check out our [documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual)

---



# -------------------- IMAGE PROMPTS  --------------------

Q: What does the --iw 5 argument do? What does the --iw 5 comment do? What does --iw do?

The --iw 5 applies an image weight of 5. Read more [here](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual#image-prompting-with-url) 

---

Q: How do I upload an image? How do I get image link? How do I use my own image? How do I upload or use an image from my hard-drive for an image prompt?

The image needs to be online, with a public URL, which you can do using Discord. If it's already online somewhere, right click on the image to 'copy image address (or link)' and go to step 5:

On desktop:

1. Drag an image into Discord
2. Press enter to send it in the chat
3. Click the image in discord so that it's fullscreen
4. Right click it and press "copy image address"
5. Type `/imagine` and then paste the address in the prompt area.

On Mobile:

1. Push the plus in the lower left then click 'upload'
2. Press 'send message' to send it into the chat
3. Click the image in discord so that it's fullscreen
4. Push share then click 'copy url'
5. Type `/imagine` and then paste the address in the prompt area.

---

Q: How can I attach an image? Can I use an image as a starting point? Can I use my images? Can I send images to the AI? I've seen a few people using source images, how does this work?

You can use your images as an inspiration for the AI.
Type `/imagine` prompt as normal, but then in the prompt section, paste in the web address where the image is stored online. After the link you can still add new text prompts to complement it.  You can see some examples in the Imagine Parameters visual guide [here](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#image-prompting-with-url).

An image url must be a direct link to an online image, which you can usually get by right clicking on an image somewhere and choosing `Copy Link Address`. This address will usually end in a `.png` or `.jpg` if it's a usable address.

---

Q: Any tips regarding using two image sources? Can I use two images?

We don't currently support adding individual weights for images, so the most you can do is just set the global image weight with --iw.

---

Q: Is there a way to get the "image prompt" to be closer to the initial image? My result doesnt look like the image I uploaded.

Your best bet is to increase the image weight. Check https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions for more details.

---

Q: Is it possible to choose how much weight is applied to each image using --iw?

The weight specified is applied on all image prompts given to the bot.

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

Yes, with --iw -0.5.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image as the source and modify it. They often call this an "init\_image."  This is not supported by Midjourney at the moment. You can use a url as part of your prompt, along with text if you want, but it is more of an "influence image" than a true init.. [Here is a short guide on using image prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions)

---


# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it — or -- ? Is it - or - -?

It is a double hyphen with no space(--) or an em-dash.

---

Q: What does :: do? What does double colons do? What does the + on the website do?

Double colons allows you to do multiple prompts with weights (shown as a + on the website).

For more information check out our documentation https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/faqs#image-prompt-questions

--- 

Q: Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image after I have generated different versions? Can I change the prompt after?

It is not currently possible to modify a prompt after it has been used.

---

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts?

Here is a short guide on effective text prompts: [Tips on Text Prompts](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/resource-links/guide-to-prompting).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

No, everything is case-insensitive.

---

Q: How do you weigh text prompts?

Check out the explainer over on the changelog in #status: [Explainer](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148/960181257394868224).  Basically, it says:

You can suffix any part of the prompt with `::0.5` to give that part a weight of 0.5. If the weight is not specified, it defaults to 1;

Some examples: `/imagine hot dog::2 food::-1` - This sends a text prompt of `hot dog` with the weight 2 and `food` of weight -1.

`/imagine hot dog::0.5 animal::-0.25` - This sends `hot dog` of weight 0.5 and `animal` of negative 0.25.

`/imagine hot dog:: food::-1 animal::` - Sends `hot dog` of weight 1, `food` of weight -1 and `animal` of weight 1 (unspecified weights default to 1).

Watch out for prompts such as `/imagine hot dog animal::0.5`, as this will send the prompt of `hot dog animal` with weight 0.5, because of how it parses the text before the colons. The sum of weights also can not be lower than zero.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have. Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

Yes, the model considers them like a break in the prompt, but it's not always clear what impact this will have. Use `::` between prompts for a hard separator.

---

Q: This :: 2 that :: 3” or this : : that

Make sure that there is no space between colons and the weight. Your prompt should look like “phrase one::2 phrase two::1” 

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Anything over around 60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (It must stay under 6000 characters.)

---


# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? How do I DM myself the job results?

React to your image with the envelope emoji :envelope: and it will send it to you in DM.

%image=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167305579-1b2c461f-03d7-4aad-b14e-9ce0dd74fd9a.png

---

Q: Are the 4 initial images generated using the same seed?

In a way, yes. We use the seed to generate noise (think randomness) for all 4 images at once so the noise is different for each image.

---

Q: Does submitting the job again use a different seed?

Yes, unless you specify --seed with a number.

---

Q: What exactly does --seed stabilize? What does –seed do?

Seed means that the random noise we add during the initialization of the generation will be the same each time but GPUs are non-deterministic, so the images won't look exactly the same.

---


# -------------------- ------SHOW----- --------------------

Q: How to transfer an image to another channel? Can I move my image out of the newbies channel? Can I work with my old generations? My old generation is not responding to buttons? Can i upscale my old image from newbies channel? How to use /show?

You can use /show commands to transfer the image to another channel. Or even ‘revive’ a  job that is not working anymore for some reason. You will need the job Id for that, it can be copied by pressing the “copy job ID” button in the gallery (from the … menu).
Use `/show jobid` in any channel or DM.
Like `/show b052e414-a9f7-4f14-94fe-1a43e0aa656b`

---


# -------------------- ------VIDEO----- --------------------

Q: Can I use –video on an upscale?

We don't support videos for upscaling right now. Only for grids.

---

Q: How do I get a video of my grid generating?

Add --video to the end of your prompt.  Once your image has rendered react to it with the :envelope: emoji.

---

# -------------------- ------INFO------- --------------------

Q: How can I see the quota left in my account? How can I see how many images I have left? How can I see how much fast-hours I have? Where can I see how many images I have generated?


You can type /info to see more information about your account.

---


# -------------------- --CANCEL X--------- --------------------

Q: How can I delete an image? How to delete images from my feed?

You can delete a generation by reacting with :x: emoji to it. 

---






# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- ---WEBSITE--- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: How do I search for someone on the website? 

Type their name in the search bar on top under 'Community Feed'

---

Q: Do I need a subscription for the community feed? Do I need a subscription to see the member gallery?

Yes you need a subscription to see the member gallery or community feeds.

---

Q: Is there a way to save all my images at once?

We don't have a batch download feature yet. The fastest is to go to your web gallery feed, open an image, then click on the save icon. You can use the right arrow to move to the next image and repeat the operation.

---

Q: What is the Feed?

# -------------------- ERRORS --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why am I getting a message that says "Job encountered an error, likely due to lack of memory"?

Try using --w and --h as multiple of 64 and under 1024, e.g. `--w 256 --h 320`

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Interaction Failed"? I am getting “interaction failed”? I am getting “application did not respond”?

Make sure your discord app is updated and try restarting it. If you get this with your DMs with the bot, make sure your security settings allow DMs. It is also possible there is a maintenance going on, check the #status channel for updates.

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"? I get an error when I try to create a thread?

We reached the max number of threads we can create on the server. it will be possible to add new threads when older threads will archive. In the meantime, feel free to work in Direct Messages with the bot.

The banned word list is not publicly available.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- THREADS --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Where did my thread go? Where is my thread? Why can’t I see newbie channels? Can you move threads? Can you help me move threads? Can you add me to newbie channel? Will my work disappear if I can’t find the thread? How can I find thread? Where is thread? Can you move my thread? Can I change roles? What is my group role? What is this role? Where did channel go? Where did my channel go? Channel disappeared? Thread disappeared? Thread gone? 

In order to move towards open-beta while still playing nice with Discord backend infrastructure we have had to make some changes with how newbie and general channels are structured. 
This means that we have assigned new roles which will limit the newbie/general channels you are able to see. Because of this, we have also had to limit the creation of new threads in those channels, and you may lose access to threads you’ve created. 

Unfortunately, we are unable to move these threads, or change your role permissions to go back into another newbie/general channel.
To make this change easier we've added a /show command that lets you move 'any' job you've made into a new thread, DM or channel. 

To use this command:
1) Go to your gallery at https://www.midjourney.com/app/
2) Find your image you want to move to a new place
3) Click the ... button then "copy job id"
4) Go to discord and type /show job_id and your job will appear in the new channel/thread/dm

You can also make a new thread in #misc-threads and #jam-threads to continue collaborating with your friends.

We're very sorry if this causes anyone inconvenience but it's necessary for us to continue to take this wonderful community into the next phase.

Q: Can I change the prompt after I’ve made it? Can I change the prompt?

Right now, once you’ve made an image you cannot change the prompt. You can, however, create new images with new prompts from scratch at any time.

Q: Can I use other people’s images for commercial projects? 

Please ask them first.

# -------------------- GUIDE KEYBINDS --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: guideStop

Adding the --stop parameter will stop your generation at an earlier percentage. 


In this example: /imagine prompt: an abstract field of flowers --stop 50
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in softer less detailed images. 
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image. 

See [the documentation](https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/imagine-parameters#detail-modifiers), for more information.
