Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons? How do I upscale? How do I increase my image‚Äôs resolution? How do I create variations? What does U and V do? What is U1-4, V1-4? What is an upscale? What is a variation?

**U** UPSCALE: The 'U'üî¢ buttons separate your chosen image from the grid, making it easier to download and giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.

**V** VARIATION: The 'V'üî¢ buttons create 4 [variations](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/variations) of the selected image while keeping the style and composition.

Clicking on U doesn't use GPU time in version 5 and 6 but upscales creative, subtle, 2x and 4x consume several GPU minutes. [Read more about upscales](<https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers>)
Variations use GPU time.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Is it possible to edit a prompt without restarting? How to edit my prompt? What is remix? Can I change the prompt after I‚Äôve made it? Can I change the prompt? Is there a way to add more parameters to a generated image after I have generated different versions? Can I change the prompt? How do I recreate one of my images with a small change? Can I edit my prompt? Can I edit one of my prompts? Can I add, remove, or change just one word in my prompt? What is remix?

The `remix` feature lets you edit your prompt. Toggle it on with `/prefer remix`. When on, clicking the "V" buttons will show a text box where you can make changes to the prompt.

[What is Remix?](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029507753389084692/1029507753389084692)

Q: What does Remaster do? What is Remaster? What is the Remaster Button?

Remaster automatically reworks images made in older versions into version 5.2. The Remaster button will appear after upscaling an image. In v4 it appears after running an Upscale Redo option.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------GPU------- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: What is GPU time? What is a GPU minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms of the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query? Do upscales cost GPU time? Do variations use GPU time?

Imagine Midjourney is a ship on the imagination sea, driven by GPU (Graphics processing unit) engines. When you request an image, it's like setting a course. The "cost" is how hard the engine works, **measured in GPU time**.

With the latest models:
- `/imagine`: Costs about 1 GPU minute
- Variations: Cost slightly less GPU time
- Initial Upscales: Split the existing grid, they cost no extra GPU time (in v5 and v6)
- 2x/4x/Creative/Subtle Upscale: Cost more GPU time, various minutes.

Keep in mind - Requests like panning, Vary (Region), using older models, or adding specific instructions push the engine more, increasing the GPU time.

---

Q: How do I see how many gpu hours I have left? How do I see how much I have used? How do I see how many hours I have left? Where can I check how many prompts I have left? How many images can I make? How can I see my queue? Where do I check my jobs? How do I check how many jobs I have left? /info?

Use the command `/info` to check your status and usage.

`Fast Time Remaining` shows how much fast GPU time you have available.

---

Q: Can I use my GPU? Can I run this locally? Can I run this on my computer?

No, the AI runs on datacenter grade graphics cards.

---

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details? What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? How do I enable the additional fast time?

If you are out of Fast GPU time, you can buy more with a credit top-up at the current rate of $4/hr. These purchased top-ups never expire but require an active subscription to use. Please note these minutes get consumed only after all bonus time from ranking and plan minutes have been used.

You can buy them at any time via your [account page on the website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/).

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------


# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?  My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed?

Members on the Standard, Pro or Mega plans can toggle between Relax and Fast mode using the commands `/relax` and `/fast`. Images made in `relax` mode take longer to complete but are unlimited.

üîπRelax mode is not available for Basic/trial users and does not support max-upscales.

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode uses a dynamic queueing system that resets each time your subscription is renewed.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight. Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while.  What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast-hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours?

We've got three options to help you generate images, the more relaxed `Relax` mode, the speedy `Fast` mode, and the super speedy `Turbo` mode. `Fast` and `Turbo` assign a GPU immediately while `Relax` adds your job to a queue of jobs from other users based on usage.

The ‚ÄúMega‚Äù plan gives 60 `Fast` GPU hours per month, the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù plan gives 30 hours, the "Standard" plan gives 15 hours, and the "Basic" plan gives 200 minutes.
The ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù plan does not include access to `Relax` mode.

---

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? Will my time get added to the next month? Does the subscription reset my hours? Do I keep my minutes? Do fast GPU minutes stack on each month? Does fast time rollover? Rollover? Roll over? Do I lose my hours when I change plan? Do I lose my hours when I cancel?

Monthly hours do not roll over. If you do not use your fast minutes each month, you will lose them. Earned bonus hours from ranking expire one month (30 days) after awarding. Additional purchased fast hours do not expire. Both earned bonus hours and additional purchased hours require an active subscription to use.

---
# -------------------- ------TURBO------ --------------------

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo Mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs run in Turbo mode generate up to four times faster but **consume twice as many subscription GPU minutes** as a typical Fast Mode Job.

Switch to Turbo mode with the command `/turbo` or select ‚ö°Turbo Mode in your `/settings`.
If Turbo mode can‚Äôt be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

# -------------------- SUBSCRIPTION --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Do subscriptions renew on the first of the month? When does my subscription renew? When do I get more fast time?

**Monthly Plans:** To see your next renewal date and time, run the `/info` command.

**Yearly Plans:** Your Fast Time refreshes every month on the same date and time that you originally subscribed. For example, if you subscribed on January 8th at 12pm, your hours will refresh on the 8th of every month at 12pm.

# -------------------- METERED --------------------
Q: If we go over our limit of fast hours does it let us know? Or just start billing for the extra hourly time with no warning? If I use up minutes, can I get more without paying? Can you accidentally get a big bill?

When you run out of fast time, you will be prompted to either purchase additional GPU hours or, for Standard, Pro, and Mega subscribers, switch to `/relax` mode. These additional GPU hours must be purchased before they can be used, so you can‚Äôt accidentally incur additional charges.

# -------------------- SWITCH PLANS --------------------

Q: If I want to switch plans will I be charged the full amount? What if I go from basic plan to standard? Can I change my plan? Can I get the $10 sub and, if I run out, upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I get the $10 sub and if I run out upgrade and just pay the difference? Can I switch plans? If I switch to Standard it will be 20$ or 30$ ? Can I upgrade from basic to standard?

You can decide to switch plans at any time. If you're thinking about upgrading, you can choose to do it right away and get prorated credit for any unused fast time.

If you‚Äôve used all of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 30$.
If you‚Äôve used half of the Basic time -> Standard will cost 25$
If you‚Äôve used no Basic time -> Standard will cost $20

Or, if you'd prefer, you can schedule the change to happen automatically at the end of your current billing period. Downgrades only occur at the end of the billing period.

---

Q: How do I upgrade? Where do I upgrade? What do I have to do to upgrade?

Want to switch your subscription type? Go to the [Manage Sub page on the Midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/account/). Below your info, you'll see available plans with features.

Subscriptions can only be transferred between accounts that have the same owner. Images can not be transferred from one account to another.
Reach out to billing@midjourney.com to request a transfer.

---

# -------------------- QUEUE --------------------

Q: How many jobs can be generating at once? How many jobs can I line up? How long is the queue? How many concurrent jobs can I run? How many can I queue?

`Basic`, and `Standard` subscribers can have **3 jobs** running at once. Additional jobs will be added to a queue of up to **10 jobs**.

`Pro`and `Mega` subscribers can run **12 jobs** at once with `/fast`, **3 jobs** at once with `/relax`, and an additional **10 jobs** in the queue.

---

Q: Queue reset? Can I have a queue reset? Reset my queue? Reset jobs?

To cancel running jobs, you can:
üîπReact to the job with the :x: emoji.
üîπOr, right-click on the job, go to "Apps", and select "Cancel Job".

Can't find the job? Use `/info` to get a link to its location. Remember, you can only cancel jobs that are currently running, not those queued.

If you are experiencing long wait times with jobs starting, please refer to [status.midjourney.com](https://status.midjourney.com/) for estimated queue times or [#status](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/942231458918064148) for current bot updates. In many cases, it's more efficient to wait for your job to start than to cancel and restart it.

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? Pay for stealth mode? What if I don‚Äôt want my images to appear in the gallery?

Midjourney is a community for sharing and exploration, but if you don't want to participate, you can subscribe to the Pro or Mega plan. The Pro and Mega plans have a feature called `Stealth` that lets you choose what to publish/unpublish in your public Gallery and community feed.

---

Q: What's private mode? What‚Äôs stealth mode? Private powers badge? I don't want people to see my images. How can I work privately? I don't want anyone to see my images and prompts. How do I go private? How do I go stealth? How much does private cost? How much does stealth cost? I can‚Äôt unpublish on the website? Stealth mode? How do I keep my images private?

Stealth mode is a feature of the Pro and Mega plans which lets users selectively unpublish their images from the [Midjourney website‚Äôs gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/explore).

To turn on Stealth mode for all new images to be unpublished, run the `/stealth` command. You can also add it to individual prompts by using `--stealth`

üîπTo keep images completely hidden, you must make them in DMs or a private server. Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels.

---

Q: How to hide images? What is hide? What does hide do on the website? Is hide the same as private mode? Hide images?

`Hide` only hides images from yourself, it‚Äôs useful to clear images you don‚Äôt like from [your own gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine). **Hidden images are still visible to all other members**, it is not the same as unpublishing them.
`Unpublish` makes your images private. Only you can see them on [the website gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/explore), other members can not. You need a Pro or Mega plan to unpublish images and use [Stealth mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth).

To hide or unpublish images on the website, go to [My Images](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine), select the images you want to unpublish, and click `...More` next to Download. You can then bulk unpublish/publish or hide/unhide.

---

Q: Is private permanent? Does stealth last forever? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth? Are unpublished images visible once my subscription ends?

Any images unpublished using Stealth mode during your subscription will remain private even after your subscription ends, or if you downgrade your plan.

---

Q: I can‚Äôt see the eye icon.

If the eye icon doesn‚Äôt appear, try using the /info command, logging out, and then re-logging into the website.

---

Q: Are all my images private automatically? Will my gallery become private? Why can users still interact even though I bought private? Are all my images stealth automatically? Will my gallery be stealth? Why can users interact even though I have stealth mode enabled?

Stealth mode is a feature of the Pro and Mega plan which can be enabled with the `/stealth` command or by adding `--stealth` to individual prompts. On the website, any previously made images can be toggled between published and unpublished with the eye icon.

üîπTo keep images completely hidden, you must make them in DMs or a private server. Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels.

---

Q: How do I unpublish my images? Unpublish old images? Bulk unpublish? Unpublish already made images? Batch unpublish?

Subscribers to the Pro and Mega plan can bulk unpublish their images from the website. To do this, go to [My Images](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine), select the images you want to unpublish, and click `...More` next to Download. You can then bulk publish/unpublish.

# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: How do I change my aspect ratio? How to change aspect ratio? How can I specify image width? How can I specify image height? How can I change the dimensions? How to make not square images? What is the prompt for width and height? Can I adjust the width and height? What is --ar? How do I make a desktop background? How do I make 16:9?

Change the aspect ratio of your image with the `--ar` parameter at the end of your prompt.

Ex: `/imagine prompt: cyberpunk cats --ar 16:9`

[Aspect Ratio Documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/aspect-ratios) for more information.

---

Q: The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

In v6: `Upscale (Subtle)` is the closest match to grid images.
`Upscale (Creative)` adds the most detail when upscaling images.
Running the upscale again will give you a different result. [Read more about the different upscales](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using a more recent version, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in `/fast` mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image‚Äôs resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.
[Read about the different upscales](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` parameter in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúLight Upscale Redo‚Äù button under v3 and v4 upscaled images.
[Read about the different upscales](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is "beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is upbeta?

Beta upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds flat textured smooth detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--upbeta` parameter in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúBeta Upscale Redo‚Äù button under v3 and v4 upscaled images.
[More about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print them out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution?

For square images, the upscalers will produce the following:
v5, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0 grid upscale: 1024x1024 px
v5, 5.1, 5.2 (2x) Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px
v5, 5.1, 5.2 (4x) Upscaler: 4098 x 4098 px
v6 (Creative) and (Subtle) Upscaler: 2048 x 2048 px

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size. [Read more about resolution and upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)
If you need larger or higher resolution images, please look into 3rd party upscale softwares.

---

Q: Is the v4 upscaler broken? Why are my Version 4 upscales coming out different?

The default upscaler for v4 takes the prompt into account, unlike previous upscalers. This means it sometimes makes changes to the grid image as part of the process‚Äìfor better or for worse. If you don‚Äôt like the results, try the ‚ÄúBeta Upscale Redo‚Äù button. The beta upscaler tends to stick closer to the grid image than the Version 4 default upscaler :)

---

Q: Where has the upscale 4x button gone? Upscale 2x and Upscale 4x do now show for me? Have you removed 4x upscale? 4x upscale? Upscale (4x)?

At the moment, version 6 only has `Upscale (Subtle)` and `Upscale (Creative)` which are both Upscales 2x.
If you want an Upscale (4x) you need to go back to --v 5.2. Use the command `/settings`, select Version 5.2 and create a new /imagine - new images will have the 4x Upscale button.

Q: Quality Buttons Disappeared from Settings? Quality Buttons? Quality Buttons Gone? Quality Buttons Disappear? How to set Quality? Quality in Settings?

The Quality buttons have been removed from the `/settings` panel because on v4 and v5 models the default quality setting is already the maximum value (q 1). If you wish to lower the quality setting or use higher values on older versions, you can use the [Quality Parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality) on your prompt or set a [custom suffix](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/settings-and-presets#prefer-suffix) to automatically add a custom quality parameter.

[Here‚Äôs a step by step guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Can an image prompt have a negative weight?

Yes, with --iw -0.5.

---

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called `init` images. `Init` images are not currently supported. You can use an image URL as part of your prompt, but it is more of an "influence image" than a true init.
[Image Prompt Guide](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Is there a max iw? What‚Äôs the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

Yes, the maximum image weight is 10000, but weights are relative to other weights in the prompt. Extreme weights will give diminishing returns.
[How to use image prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts)

---

Q: Is there a way to mix two images. Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

**Use `/blend` to mix two or more images together.**

[Read more about Blend](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/blend-1)

---

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it ‚Äî or -- ? Is it - or - -?

It is a double hyphen with no space (`--`) or an em-dash (`‚Äî`), followed by your parameter, with no space after the hyphens or em dash. For example: `something --ar 16:9` and `something ‚Äîar 16:9` are equally valid.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to do multiple prompts (shown as a + in the prompt description on the website). You can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result.

[More information about Multi Prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts).

---

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts? How should I write my prompts?  What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts? Do prompts have an order? Does word order matter? Does word sequence matter? Is there a template for prompts?

[Here is a guide on effective text prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

No, the bot is not case-sensitive.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

The only punctuation with a designed impact is `::` for [multi prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/multi-prompts) and ‚Äúbrackets‚Äù to force text.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Anything over ~60 words will not affect the output, so don't write a novel. (Prompts must stay under 6000 characters.)

[Read more about prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why teal and orange? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your stylization value might be too high. High stylization values will result in ‚Äúpretty‚Äù but less nuanced results. Try lowering the stylization value in the `/settings` menu or by adding a stylize argument (ex. `--s 625`).

---

Q: What about ‚ÄúUnreal engine‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúArtstation‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúOctane render‚Äù?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

[Read about rendering words](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/1029786943141191700/1029786943141191700)

---

Q: What does quality do? How do you use  --q? How do you use quality? What is --q?

*Quality*: Adjust the quality of your render by appending `--q` and the value of `.25`, `.5` or `1`. Each level will adjust the GPU computation time and cost by the equivalent amount. Ex: `--q .5` The default value is 1.

[Read more about Quality](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality)

---

Q: How do you use --s? How do you use stylize? What does stylize do? What is --s?

*Stylization* Adjust how closely the Bot follows your prompt by changing the stylization value. Append `--s` and a value between 0-1000. Lower values will follow your prompt closely. Higher values will have more variability. The default value is 100.

[Read more about Stylize](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? How can I get an individual image without upscaling? No seed? Seed on upscale? Only grid seed? V5 seed? I can not get the seed? Can‚Äôt get the seed number? When I react with the envelope nothing happens, I don‚Äôt get the seed? How can I find the seed? How do I retrieve the seed number of an image? How do I get the seed of an image? What does ‚Äìseed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed?

A *Seed* is the random noise that starts image generation for all four grid images at once. Put an ‚úâÔ∏èreact on the grid and the bot will DM you the seed.

*You may need to check your privacy settings to receive Direct Messages from the bot.
Note: When using seeds, images may not look identical due to non-deterministic GPUs.

# -------------------- ------SHOW----- --------------------

Q: How to transfer an image to another channel? Can I move my image out of the newbies channel? Can I work with my old generations? My old generation is not responding to buttons? Can i upscale my old image from newbies channel? How to use /show?

Use the `/show` command to transfer an image to another channel, or ‚Äúrevive‚Äù a job that's not working. You need the Job ID, which you can get from the website by clicking the `copy job ID` button in the gallery.

Use `/show jobid` in any channel or your Direct Messages.

# -------------------- ------VIDEO----- --------------------

Q: How do I get a video of my grid generating? Video? --video? Can I use ‚Äìvideo on an upscale?

You can ask the bot to record the creation of the image you prompted. This __does not work with version 4__.

Add `--video` to the end of your prompt. Once the image has been rendered, react to it with the :envelope: emoji. Videos only work on the initial grid, not upscaled images.

Q: ‚Äìstop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter will stop your generation at partway through.

In this example: `/imagine prompt: a field of flowers --stop 50`
The grid will stop generating 50% of the way through resulting in a softer less detailed image.
The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image.

See [the documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stop) for more information.

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing?

Some jobs may appear *ephemeral* when certain words or phrases are mentioned. These temporary messages are only visible to **you** and disappear when you close, refresh, or switch instances of Discord. You'll know it's an ephemeral job when you see the text "Only you can see this message" at the bottom of the bot's message.

Don't worry, even if these jobs disappear from Discord, you can still find them in your [Web Gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/imagine/).

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [/show command](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/show-job) followed by the job ID.

Keep all your images visible by generating in [Direct Messages](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/direct-messages) with the bot.
