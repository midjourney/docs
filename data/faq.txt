Q: What do the U1, V1, etc. buttons do? U, V buttons? What does U and V do? What is U1-4, V1-4? 

**U** UPSCALE: The Uüî¢ buttons separate your chosen image from the grid, giving you access to additional editing and generation tools.

**V** VARIATION: The Vüî¢ buttons create 4 [variations](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/variations) of the selected image while keeping the style and composition.

Clicking on U doesn't use GPU time in the current version 6 but upscales creative and subtle consume several GPU minutes. [Read more about upscales](<https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers>)
Variations use GPU time.

Q: How do I upscale? What is an upscale? 

Click on Uüî¢ buttons to separate an image from the grid and get options to modify this image. *This does not use any GPU time.*

You can then **upscale the image to double the size**. *This uses about double the GPU time used to create a grid.*
üîπ`Upscale (Subtle)` is the closest match to the original image.
üîπ`Upscale (Creative)` adds the most detail when upscaling an image.
Running the upscale again will give you a different result.

[Read more about Upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is a variation? How do I create variations?

Click on Vüî¢ buttons under a grid, or `Vary` (subtle or strong) under a single image, to generate new images based on it. 
üîπ`Vary (Subtle)` retains the basic composition and colors, creating four new images with slightly different details.
üîπ`Vary (Strong)` creates four new interpretations of your prompt, while referencing elements of the original.

__Note:__ Use the command </settings:1000850743479255081> to set the mode used for Vüî¢ buttons.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Submit your `Vary (Region)` request ‚ûú

You cannot edit an image which has been upscaled; upscaling is the last step.
__Note:__ A larger selection provides more room for changes, while a smaller selection may result in more subtle modifications. [Read more about Vary Region](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/vary-region)

---

Q: How do I create variations? What is a variation? Vary subtle or strong? What is the difference between Vary subtle and strong?

Create [variations](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/variations) of an image you made on Midjourney to generate new images based on it.

Click one of the Vüî¢ buttons underneath you grid to make variations or click on the Uüî¢ buttons to isolate the image and then choose :magic_wand: `Vary (Subtle)` or `Vary (Strong)`.
üîπVary **(Subtle)**: Retains the basic composition and colors, creating four new images with slightly different details.
üîπVary **(Strong)**: Creates four new interpretations of your prompt, while referencing elements of the original.

Select the Variation mode used for your Vüî¢ buttons with the command </settings:1000850743479255081>.

__Note:__ To edit your prompt when making variations, activate [`Remix mode`](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/remix) in your </settings:1000850743479255081>.

Q: What is GPU time? What is a GPU minute? Does the reroll/variation/upscale each count as a generation in terms of the limits? 4 small images count as 1 job? How many images is one query? What is a query? Do upscales cost GPU time? Do variations use GPU time?

Similar to credits, creating an image uses GPU time. With the latest version 6.1:
- `/imagine`: Costs about 1 GPU minute
- Variations: Cost slightly less GPU time
- Grid Upscales: Split the existing grid, they cost no extra GPU time (in v5 and v6)
- 2x/4x/Creative/Subtle Upscale: Cost more GPU time

How long you wait in ‚Äúreal life time‚Äù does not affect how much GPU time is consumed.

Q: How many images can I make?

Use the command </info:972289487818334209> to check your status and usage.
`Fast Time Remaining` shows how much fast GPU time you have available.

On average, each generation consumes about 1 GPU minute. So if you have 200 GPU minutes, you can use the command `/imagine` approximately 200 times.

---

Q: Can I use my GPU? Can I run this locally? Can I run this on my computer?

Midjourney runs on datacenter grade graphics cards, it can only be used through our Discord Bot or our official Midjourney website.

---

Q: What are optional credit top-ups? Top-ups? What does optional credit pop-ups mean in plan details? What if I run out of fast-gpu hours? What if I run out of fast time? How do I enable the additional fast time?

You can purchase additional fast GPU hours through your [`Manage Subscription` page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) at US$4 per hour (+ VAT). These purchased hours roll over to the next month but expire after 60 days. An active subscription is required to use them.

__Note:__ These hours are used after your monthly and bonus GPU fast time.

# -------------------- FAST / RELAX --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

# -------------------- -----RELAX----- --------------------

Q: How do I go into Relax mode? How do I turn on Relax mode? How do I start Relax?  My images say "relaxed", how do I change this? Why are my images relaxed? How to get relaxed generation? Relax job? Relax generation? How to swap between relax and fast mode?

To toggle between Relax, Fast and Turbo mode, use the commands `/relax`, `/fast` or `/turbo`.
- Images made in Relax mode take longer to complete but are unlimited.
- Images made in Fast mode are quicker to start but use your limited GPU fast time.
- Images made in Turbo mode are generated much faster but consume twice the cost of a `Fast` generation.

__Note:__ Relax mode is not available on the Basic plan.
[Read more about GPU time and Speed modes.](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/fast-relax)

---

Q: Does relax mode get faster at the beginning of a billing cycle?

Yes, `Relax` mode uses a dynamic queuing system that resets with each of your monthly time renewal.

---

Q: Relaxed mode seems slow tonight? Upscaling in relaxed mode seems to be on "Waiting to Start..." for a while? What is the average wait time? How much slower is relax mode? How slow is relax mode? Relax mode speed? Why was it faster before? Relax mode is running slower?

Relax mode uses a dynamic queue to ensure equal resource access for everyone. The time it takes to generate in this mode can vary, depending on usage and available resources.

---

# -------------------- ------FAST------ --------------------

Q: What is fast mode? What does fast hours mean? Fast time? What is relax mode? In the plan it never said that I have limited fast hours? 

There are three Speed modes to generate images. Use the commands `/relax`, `/fast` or `/turbo` to select the speed you want:
üîπ**Relax** mode adds your job to a dynamic queue, it can be slower but is unlimited.
üîπ**Fast** mode starts your image right away but uses your limited GPU fast time.
üîπ**Turbo** mode starts your job right away and processes it as fast as possible but consumes twice as much GPU time as in Fast mode.

Each plan comes with a limited amount of monthly GPU fast time. You can buy more on [your account page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) on the website.
The Basic plan does not include access to Relax mode.

Q: Do fast hours roll over? Do I keep my unused fast hours? Will my time get added to the next month? Does the subscription reset my hours? Do I keep my minutes? Do fast GPU minutes stack on each month? Does fast time rollover? Rollover? Roll over? Do I lose my hours when I change plan? Do I lose my hours when I cancel?

üîπ**Monthly fast time does not roll over**. It is reset with each monthly renewal.
üîπBonus hours from ranking expire one month (30 days) after being awarded.
üîπAdditional purchased fast hours expire after 60 days.

__Note:__ To create images, you need an active subscription.

---
# -------------------- ------TURBO------ --------------------

Q: What is turbo mode? What does turbo mean? Turbo mode?

Turbo mode is for extremely quick image generation. Jobs in Turbo mode are generated up to four times faster but also **consume twice as much fast GPU time** as a typical Fast mode job.

Switch to Turbo mode with the command `/turbo` or select ‚ö°Turbo mode in your </settings:1000850743479255081>.

__Note:__ If Turbo mode can‚Äôt be used, your job will run in Fast Mode instead.

# -------------------- ----PRIVATE---- --------------------
# -------------------- -------------------- --------------------

Q: Why do I have to pay for private mode? Pay for stealth mode? What if I don‚Äôt want my images to appear in the gallery?

Midjourney is a community for sharing and exploration.
If you prefer not to participate, you can subscribe to the Pro or Mega plan. These two plans include the [`Stealth` Mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth) feature that lets you choose what to publish and what to make private (unpublish) in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive).

---

Q: Are stealth images moderated? Are my private images moderated? Why are private images being moderated? Can I make nudes in Stealth mode? Why are stealth images being moderated?

Images created in Stealth mode can be viewed by our team for moderation purposes. They are still subject to the [Terms of Service](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/community-guidelines).

By default, your prompts and images are public on the [Midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/explore).
[Stealth mode](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stealth) is a feature of the Pro and Mega plans that allows you to make your images private (unpublished) so they cannot be viewed by others on the website.

To enable Stealth mode and keep all **__new__** images private on the Midjourney website: run the `/stealth` command.
To unpublish your public images, select them in [your gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) and click `...More` next to Download to find the `Unpublish` button.

__Note:__ Images made in public channels are visible by anyone in those channels! To hide them on Discord, you need to [make them in Direct Messages](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/direct-messages) or [in a private server](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/add-the-bot).

---

Q: Is private permanent? Does stealth last forever? If I cancel, are my images still private? Is stealth permanent? If I cancel switch plans are my images still stealth? Are unpublished images visible once my subscription ends?

Q: The upscale adds too much detail? How do I remove the noise from an upscaled image?

üîπ`Upscale (Subtle)` is the closest match to the original image.
üîπ`Upscale (Creative)` adds the most detail when upscaling an image.
Running the upscale again will give you a different result.

[Read more about Upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: I don't see the Max Upscale option? No Max Upscale? Where is Max Upscale?

The Max Upscaler is an upscaler for Version 3. If you are using a more recent version, this option will not be available. This feature is only available in `/fast` mode. You may not see an upscale option for some aspect ratios that would produce a file over the maximum size the bot can create. Check your upscaled image‚Äôs resolution: it may already be at the maximum resolution.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Light Upscale Redo"? What is a light upscale? How do I use light upscale? What is uplight?

Light upscale is an upscaler for Version 3 and 4. It uses a different algorithm that adds less detail, which may be better in some cases. You can use the `--uplight` parameter in a prompt, or hit the ‚ÄúLight Upscale Redo‚Äù button under v3 and v4 upscaled images.

[Read more about Upscaler Models](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: What is "Beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is "beta Upscale Redo"? What is a beta upscale? How do I use beta upscale? What is upbeta?

Q: What is the maximum upscale resolution? What is the maximum resolution?  How can I set the resolution? Can I make a 4K image? Can I make a 300 DPI image? Can I make the resolution higher? Can I print my image? Is it possible to save my creations in high resolution, so I can print them out as posters? Is there a way to set the resolution to 2k and higher? How do I choose a resolution? How do I increase my image‚Äôs resolution? How can i make a 4k resolution?

For square images in the current version, the upscalers will produce the following:
A grid upscale: 1024x1024 px
A (Creative) and (Subtle) Upscale: 2048 x 2048 px

Custom aspect ratios set using `--ar` will change the width and height of the image, but not the max file size.
If you need larger or higher resolution images, you can look into 3rd party upscale softwares.

__Note:__ Rolling a (Creative) or (Subtle) upscale another time will still produce a 2048 x 2048 px result.
[Read more about resolution and upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers)

---

Q: Where has the upscale 4x button gone? Upscale 2x and Upscale 4x do now show for me? Have you removed 4x upscale? 4x upscale? Upscale (4x)?

At the moment, version 6 only has `Upscale (Subtle)` and `Upscale (Creative)` which are both Upscales 2x. [Read more about Upscalers](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers-1)

If you want an Upscale (4x) you need to go back to --v 5.2. Use the command </settings:1000850743479255081>, select Version 5.2 and create a new /imagine - new images will have the 4x Upscale button.

The Quality buttons have been removed from the </settings:1000850743479255081> panel because on v4 and v5 models the default quality setting is already the maximum value (q 1). If you wish to lower the quality setting or use higher values on older versions, you can use the [Quality Parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quality) on your prompt or set a [custom suffix](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/settings-and-presets#prefer-suffix) to automatically add a custom quality parameter.

---

Q: What does quality do? How do you use --q? How do you use quality? What is --q?

The `--quality` parameter (`--q`) changes how much time is spent generating an image.
With the current Version 6.1, you can use the following values: `0.5`, `1` and `2`. The default value is 1.
For example: `Blurry glitch art of a bat --q 0.5`

The default value of the `--stylize` parameter is 100. You can adjust it by adding the `--s` parameter at the end of your prompt with a value from 0 to 1000.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.

Q: Is there a way to use "init" images for the bot to start from? Can I use an init image?

Some image generation tools can take a starting image and modify it. Images used this way are often called "init" images. "Init" images are not currently supported, you can not modify your own images through Midjourney.
You can use an image URL as part of your prompt to add an image prompt. However, these are used as prompts or references, not as a starting point.

Q: Is there a max iw? What‚Äôs the max iw? What is the max image weight? Is there a maximum image weight?

The maximum value for the image weight parameter `--iw` is 3.

Q: Is there a way to mix two images. Can I combine images? Can I blend images?

Use `/blend` to mix two or more images together.

[Read more about Blend](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/blend-1)

---

# -------------------- TEXT PROMPTS --------------------

Q: Is it ‚Äî or --? Is it - or - -?

To manually input a parameter, type a double hyphen with no space (`--`) followed by the parameter name. There should only be a space before the double hyphen and after the parameter name.
For example: `landscape --ar 3:2`

__Note:__ You can use an em dash (`‚Äî`) instead of a double hyphen.

---

Q: What does :: do? What do double colons do? What are weights? How do weights work? What does :: mean? What are multi prompts?

Double colons allow you to blend different prompts. By adding a number right after the double colons, without a space, you can give each prompt a different weight to fine-tune your result. The default weight value is 1.
In this example: `space:: ship::2`
The prompt `space` has the default weight value of 1 while the prompt `ship` has a weight value of 2, giving it twice as much influence.

Q: Any tips for successful text prompts? How do I write better prompts? How should I write my prompts?  What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts? Do prompts have an order? Does word order matter? Does word sequence matter? Is there a template for prompts?

[Here is a guide on effective text prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts).

---

Q: Setting language? Can I change to a different language? Can I use it in another language? Can I use a different language?

Text prompts work best in English but some words in other languages can be understood. If you use Niji, you can type text in English, Korean, Japanese, or Chinese.
To change the language your Discord app is displayed in, [follow this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/216406447-How-can-I-change-Discord-s-Language).

---

Q: Is letter case taken into consideration in producing the results to the prompt? Is the bot case sensitive? Does capitalization matter?

Text prompts are not case-sensitive, while parameters are case-sensitive and must be entered using lowercase letters.

---

Q: Do commas, pipes, or any other punctuation matter? Does punctuation matter?

In the default version of Midjourney (Version 6), punctuation is interpreted similarly to natural language. Compose your text prompt as you would structure a sentence to describe an image.

Some characters have a specific function:
üîπ"Quotation marks" indicate that the text enclosed within them should appear in the image.
üîπDouble hyphens (`--`) or an em dash (`‚Äî`) are used to manually input a parameter.

---

Q: What is the length limit for prompts? How long of a prompt can I write? Is there a character limit to prompts?

Different versions of Midjourney have different limits. The current model, Version 6, is much better at understanding prompts, similarly to natural language. You can type a single word, emoji or character but you can also input full sentences, it‚Äôs up to you!

[Read more about prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/prompts-2)

---

Q: Why are my images the same color? Why does it ignore my prompt? Why is the image so different from my prompt? Why do I keep seeing the same woman/man? Why are my generations always so similar?

Your `stylize` parameter value might be too high, try lowering it.
Stylization adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt. 
The default value of the `--stylize` parameter is 100. You can adjust it by adding the `--s` parameter at the end of your prompt with a value from 0 to 1000.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

---

Q: What about ‚ÄúUnreal engine‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúArtstation‚Äù? What about ‚ÄúOctane render‚Äù?

The AI responds to these phrases the same way it does with other words. However, they may give the Bot a hint to generate the style of image you want.

Participate in our [#prompt-craft](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713) community to discuss prompts with other users.

# -------------------- ----SEEDS----- --------------------

Q: How do I get the seed or job id that was used for an image? No seed? Seed on upscale? Only grid seed? I can not get the seed? Can‚Äôt get the seed number? When I react with the envelope nothing happens, I don‚Äôt get the seed? How can I find the seed? How do I retrieve the seed number of an image? How do I get the seed of an image? Where to find seed? Where is seed?

To find an image‚Äôs seed number, open your image in [your archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) and in the image menu, click on `Copy` > `Seed`.
You can only copy the seed of your own images. You can only copy the seed of an initial grid image.

__Note:__ Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency. [Read more about seeds](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/seeds)

%image=https://cdn.midjourney.com/u/d6f915c1-a3b1-425d-9934-3fb714cd8b7b/334b0b94ebf7894b7ba9efb4b564c3e5f2370bce271652b1d91e7fb44d8eb239.png

---

Q: What does ‚Äìseed do? Does submitting the job again use a different seed? What is a seed? What do seeds do? What is sameseed?

Each set of four images made in Midjourney uses a random seed number as a starting point.
Use the `--seed` parameter, with a value between 0 and 4294967295, to give the bot a specific starting point.
If you use the same seed and prompt as another image, the bot will produce an identical or very similar set of four images. This is useful when using similar prompts to test how the changes affect the result.

To find an image‚Äôs seed number, open your image in [your archive](https://www.midjourney.com/archive) and in the image menu, click on `Copy` > `Seed`. You can only copy the seed of your own images.

__Note:__ Seeds are not reliable and change over time. They have no effect on character consistency.

---

# -------------------- ------VIDEO----- --------------------

Q: How do I get a video of my grid generating? Video? --video? Can I use ‚Äìvideo on an upscale?

Midjourney currently only generates images. You can ask the bot to record the creation of the image grid you prompted.

Add the `--video` parameter at the end of your prompt. Once the image has been rendered, react to it with the :envelope: emoji to receive the video in your Direct Messages.

__Note:__ Videos only work on the initial grid, not upscaled images. [Read more about --video](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/video)

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Interaction Failed"? I am getting ‚Äúinteraction failed‚Äù? I am getting ‚Äúapplication did not respond‚Äù? Bot interaction failing?

First check  <#942231458918064148> for known issues.
If you are getting an error, try restarting Discord, updating it, or reinstalling it.

---

Q: Why did I get a message that said "Server has reached limit of active threads"? I get an error when I try to create a thread?

Discord allows this server a maximum number of active threads. When older threads are archived, you can create a new thread. Until space becomes available, you can work in Direct Messages with the Bot or invite the Bot to your server.

A green button to accept the [Terms of Service](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/terms-of-service) should appear when you first use the command `/imagine`.
Use the official Discord app and try several times if you don't see the TOS button or get an error accepting it.

üñ•Ô∏è**PC/Mac**  Do a hard restart of Discord with `Alt+F4` or `‚åò+Q`.
üì± **Mobile** `Update` the Discord app. If that doesn‚Äôt work, `reinstall` the Discord app.

---

Q: Is there a list of banned words? Where can I see the banned words?

The current Midjourney models do not use a banned word list. Rather, the bot attempts to parse the context of the prompt. Sometimes, the bot may misinterpret the prompt, in which case you will need to reword it. Repeatedly submitting blocked prompts may result in a temporary timeout for your account.

Q: Why is my image saying blocked by image filter? Request cancelled due to image filters? Image denied, request cancelled due to image filters?

To prevent abuse and content against our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/community-guidelines), images in prompts have an extra cautious filter. It doesn't necessarily mean the images are against our Community Guidelines, but to be safe, they can't be used for prompts.
Here are some things to avoid in image prompts:
üîπShirtless characters (regardless of their gender)
üîπCleavage or too much visible skin
üîπNude or skin tone clothing
You can adjust the image or use text instead. Ask our [#prompt-craft](https://discord.com/channels/662267976984297473/992207085146222713) community if you have trouble finding the right words.

__Note:__ The origin of the image does not matter. Every image is filtered the same way, whether it's a famous image or an image created by Midjourney itself.
The filter is automated and can occasionally misinterpret the content.

Q: What does progress images have been disabled mean? What does process images have been disabled mean?

In-progress images are sometimes disabled temporarily for performance reasons. Do not worry! Final results will still be sent normally when the generation is complete.

Q: Cannot use --version 6 with only a single image prompt? Only a single image prompt? Please add another image prompt, or a text prompt?

If you want to use just one image reference, you must include a text prompt with it. Prompts with multiple image references do not require a text prompt.

For example: `https://pic1.png a cool person flying like superman`

---

Q: --stylize must be between 0 and 1000 with --version 6? stylize must be between 0 and 1000?

Use the command </settings:1000850743479255081> and select `Style Med` to use the Version‚Äôs default value for Stylize.

`Stylization` adjusts how much the bot applies the default styling of the model, it also affects how closely the bot follows your prompt.
The values range from 0 to 1000, and the default value is 100.
üîπLower values will follow your prompt closely.
üîπHigher values give the bot more freedom to interpret the prompt but may dismiss some specifics.

[Read more about the Stylize parameter](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/stylize)

Q: My images won't finish? Stops at 93%? 93% bug? Stops at 62%? 62% bug?

In some cases, the bot may fail to return the finished image in Discord. You can find the finished image in [your gallery](https://midjourney.com/archive) on the Midjourney website.

If you want to bring a job back into Discord:
üîπGo to your gallery and copy the job ID.
üîπIn Discord, use the [command `/show`](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/show-job) followed by the job ID.

Q: ‚Äìstop? What is the stop parameter?

Adding the `--stop` parameter followed by a number between 10 and 100 will stop your generation partway through. 100 is the default value.

In this example: `/imagine prompt: a baby red panda --stop 50`
The grid will stop halfway (50%) through the process, resulting in a softer, less detailed image.

__Note:__ The stop parameter does not work when upscaling an image.

Q: Ephemeral? What are ephemeral jobs? Why do my jobs disappear from Discord? My images are disappearing?

Some jobs may be temporary on Discord when using certain words or phrases in your prompt. The images are only visible to you and disappear when you close, refresh, or switch Discord pages. If the job is ephemeral, you‚Äôll see the text "Only you can see this message" at the bottom of the bot's message.

Q: Does Midjourney know about this style, artist, movie, game, or media?

Midjourney has a wide variety of subjects and topics in its dataset. If you find it is unfamiliar with a topic you reference in your prompt, you may need to be more specific. You can also try to provide an [image prompt](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/image-prompts), [character reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/character-reference), or [style reference](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/style-reference).
