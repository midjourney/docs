# Welcome to Midjourney: Quick Start!

Midjourney is a new research lab focused on new mediums and tools for empowering people. There are two ways to experience the tools: the Discord server, where you will generate images, and the web app at [https://www.midjourney.com/](https://www.midjourney.com/app/), where you can find a gallery of your own work and other users' creations.

### Code of Conduct

- Don't be a jerk.
- Don't use our tools to make images that could inflame, upset, or cause drama. That includes gore and adult content.
- Be respectful to other people and the team.

Make sure you are familiar with the [Full Content Guidelines](content-and-moderation-policy.md).

You can also find more detail within the Midjourney Discord server in the #rules, #faq, #announcements, and #status channels.

## Create your First Image

Once you have joined the Discord server you will be able to create a limited number of (about 25) images before needing to subscribe.

#### 1. Select one of the `#Newbies` channels from the sidebar

![Select a Newbies Channel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167752981-596a4819-163b-4c4c-9241-adfd6231a1f4.jpg)

#### 2. Use the /imagine Command

To use the Midjourney Bot, use a [Discord Slash Command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) in a Bot channel, like #newbies-1, and type`/imagine`.
Immediately after typing `/imagine` press spacebar, tab, or enter to create the **prompt** field.
Bot slash commands will only work in _Bot Channels_. Typing `/imagine` will not work in general channels like `#Support`.

#### 3. Wait as the MidJourney Bot Processes Your Request

Requests take a minute to generate four options based on your prompt.

#### 4. Upscale your Image

Two rows of buttons will appear:
The top row of buttons: `U1` `U2` `U3` and `U4` are buttons for **upscaling** your chosen image.
Upscaling an image generates a larger roughly 1024x1024 pixel version of the selected image while adding additional details.

After you use a "U" button to upscale, you will have a few more options:

'Make Variations' does the same as the "V" buttons, generating new alternatives in a grid, and the other buttons upscale even larger, or upscale again without as much detail added.

#### 5. Save Your Image

![MJ_Daisies](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/167755159-875d58d0-12b0-4e8f-ac84-1cea75590fd8.png)

You can click on the image to open it to full size, and then right-click and choose 'Save image' to save it to your local computer.

Your upscaled image (and 2x2 grid images) will immediately be visible on your website gallery at [midjourney.com/app](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

#### 6. Send Results to Your DMs (Direct Messages)

You can also react with the ✉️ emoji to direct message your upscaled image (or 2x2 grid images) to yourself using the MidJourney Bot.

#### 7. Start a Thread If You Want.

If you want a quieter place to work you can start your own thread in any of the bot channels. Note, they are still public and subject to content moderation guidelines.

![create thread](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105028755/168845499-7f721e51-ee24-434e-97fd-856e9c883238.gif)

#### 8. Have Questions?

If you have other questions you can find many answers in the `#announcements`, `#status`, `#rules`, `#faq`, and `#docs` channels.
If you still need help post your question in the `#support` channel.
