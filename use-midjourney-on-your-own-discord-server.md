If you don't see your server listed, follow the instructions in [#step5-1](use-midjourney-on-your-own-discord-server.md#step5-1 "mention")

## Use the Midjourney Bot

Once the Midjourney Bot has joined your server you can begin interacting with it using the `/imagine` command.

If this is your first time using Midjourney, refer to othe [Quick Start Guide](./) for help making your first images.

## Notes

{% hint style="info" %}
Midjourney images generated on private servers are still subject to the [content moderation policies](content-and-moderation-policy.md).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Images generated on private servers are still visible to other users on [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/all/) (unless users have the Private Powers add-on enabled)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To use the Midjourney Bot in any server users must have an active Midjourney trial or subscription. Using the `/imagine` command for the first time command will automatically begin a trial membership for new users.
{% endhint %}

## Restrict the Bot to Specific Channels

If you do not want the Midjourney Bot to be usable in specific channels go to **Edit Channel**, select the **Permissions tab**, select **@everyone** under **Roles/Members** and  **\_Uncheck\_ "Use Application Commands"**.

Users who try to use the Midjourney Bot in a channel with these permissions disabled will not see the command
