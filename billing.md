## Plans

There are 2 plans: Basic and Standard. Both can add a **Private** Power option for 20$.

### Both Plans Offer:

* Monthly subscription. Will renew automatically after 30 days by default (which can be toggled off)
* 5 friend-invites (just type `/invite` in a bot channel or DM with the bot)
* The ability to DM (Direct Message) the Bot (your images will still be in the public gallery, unless you add `/private` to your subscription)
* New commercial terms (see updated #rules)
* The ability to purchase private-by-default mode by typing `/private`
* New premium features like Max-Upscale and Batch mode (coming soon)
* Fast mode. You can buy more 'fast' hours for 4$/hr by turning on incremental billing (use `/fast` to purchase fast hours).
* Once you've successfully upgraded you'll see a new "member" role on your Discord profile.
* Access to web app member gallery at [midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

### Basic Membership ($10/month) Offers:

* Limited use (\~200 images / month)
* Fast mode only
* You can switch plans at any time under `/subscribe`. You will only pay the difference if you didn't use all of your credits.

### Standard Membership ($30/month) Offers:

* 15 gpu-hrs/month of 'fast' mode and unlimited gpu-hrs/month of 'relax' mode.
* Fast mode is enabled for new subscribers but you can switch between /relax or /fast at any time.

### Private Power Option

* All plans can work in Direct Messages (DMs) with the Midjourney Bot. The Private Power option also hides your images and prompts from the gallery.
* Private mode is still subject to the PG-13 rules of content generation however, and moderators will be alerted to violations in your prompts.

**If you have recently subscribed to Private Powers you will need to log out then back in on the website, to see the publish/unpublish buttons.**

### Incremental Billing

* Both plans can pay for more fast mode with incremental billing.
* You can set a '**spending limit**'. When you hit the spending limit it will stop you and ask you to set a new one.
* You can type `/info` at any time to see how much money you've spent.

**How to activate it:** Once you have exhausted the fast hours on your plan, you can get more by opting-in to incremental billing at a rate of $4 per GPU hour by using `/fast`. You will be asked to set a spending limit. Upon reaching that limit it will stop you and ask you to set a new one. You will only be charged for the amount of time used. You can type `/info` at any time to see how much you have currently used.

## Commercial Terms

Basically you can use unlimited images (of your own creation) for whatever you want, as long as you meet the following conditions:

1. Your account is essentially only used by you (we don't want large groups sharing single accounts).
2. If you are using our service for your work as an employee of a corporation with more than $1M/yr in revenue (and you want these terms) you MUST update to the 'corporate' plan via typing `/subscribe` and clicking "enterprise" (it is $50/mo paid annually).
3. if your project has anything to do with blockchain, you must pay a 20% royalty on revenue over $20k/mo.

Please keep in mind that these terms are beta and we will continue to iterate on them as the beta progresses. Read the complete terms in the Discord #rules channel.

## Cancellation or Changes

**Can I cancel my subscription plan?**

You can cancel your subscription at any time but the cancellation will be effective at the end of the current billing cycle. If you change your mind, you can un-cancel your plan before the end of the cycle.

**Can I change my subscription plan?**

You can generally change your subscription at any time, effective immediately. Any remaining usage or time on `Private` will be credited to your new plan. Enterprise plans are not eligible for downgrades.
