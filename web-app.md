## Where Is It?

If you are a subscriber, you can acess it (logged in with Discord credentials) at [midjourney.com/app](https://www.midjourney.com/app/).

## Using Your Gallery

The gallery shows your latest creations, among other things. You can filter by grids or upscales only, by channel, and change the sort order.

If you mouse over an image, you will see the prompt:

![Mouse over an image to see the prompt](<.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

Clicking on an image will show you more details and offer more commands:

![Click on a gallery image for more info and options, such as the ... button shown.](<.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

Another way to filter the view is by showing things you have favorited with a ❤️ reaction. If you click the heart button in the top bar, you will see only work you have reacted to with a heart emoji, including work by other others.

## What's the Feed?

The ["feed"](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/) is the community record of public upscales, which includes DMs with the bot that are not paid /private usage. If you mouse over an image, you will see the prompt.

## Image LeaderBoards and Rating

Nominate your own images (by rating them) or rate other people's images at: [https://midjourney.com/app/ranking/](https://midjourney.com/app/ranking/)

There will be prizes for winning images and members who rate large numbers of images. (WARNING: Random button mashing on ratings will be considered 'hostile' and may get you banned (don't worry otherwise, though!)

Prizes will include $40 packs of fast-gpu hours.

We will use these ratings to improve our AI so ratings are 'serious'.

## Viewing Great Images!

If you want to see the top ranked images, go to [www.midjourney.com/app/ranking/feed/](https://www.midjourney.com/app/ranking/feed/).

Also there is the [Favorites Gallery](https://www.midjourney.com/app/feed/favorites/), created when you and others give images a star rating.

## Dictionary

Available under the "More" menu button, the dictionary shows the output of single word prompts.

## Styles and Artists

Available in [Styles](https://www.midjourney.com/app/library/styles/), you can find examples of artist and style applications. Styles that aren't shown here will still probably work for you, though.

## Account and Subscription Settings

On the top right corner is your user icon. Click on it to find "Manage Plan." [This page](https://www.midjourney.com/account/) is your account settings and billing options. There are some subscription FAQs at the bottom.
